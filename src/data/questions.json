    "answer": "Inheritance is creating a PARENT-CHILD relationship between two classes where \nchild automatically get the properties and methods of the parent. \n \nFor example, in below code Employee is a Parent class and PermanentEmployee is \na child class. Now when we will create the object of the PermanentEmployee \n(derived class) then it will automatically get this CalculateSalary() method, even \nthough this CalculateSalary method is not present in the PermanentEmployee \nclass but it will automatically get it from its parent class Employee. \nInheritance Use: \n Inheritance is good for: REUSABILITY and ABSTRACTION of code \n \nFor example, if tomorrow you get a new type of Employee and that is Contract \nemployee then you can derive from the same base class Employee for getting its’ \nmethods and properties. \n \n \n \nIf you will not use inheritance, then you have to remove this base Employee class \nand write these methods and properties inside both PermanentEmployee and \nContractEmployee which is basically duplicity of code. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n18"

Which means only one base or abstract class is allowed, and rest must \nbe interfaces.  \n Multilevel inheritance – In this, there is a GrandParent class then there is a \nParent class which is derived from GrandParent class and then there is Child \nclass which is derived from Parent class. \n \nGrandparent class -> Parent class -> Child class \n \nHere the Child class will get the properties of both Parent class and \nGrandParent class automatically. \n Hierarchal inheritance - In this One, child class is derived more from than one \nbase class.

Hiding the background details.  \nIf you have ever used a LIST collection of .NET framework then you know how to \nadd items in it and how to iterate it but do you know how it is internally using \nIEnumerable and IEnumerator and other interfaces.  \n \nSo that is abstraction.

    "question": "WHAT IS ENCAPSULATION?",
    "answer": "Encapsulation means WRAPPING of data and methods/properties into a \nsingle unit. \n \nWhy I included properties here because properties are nothing else but special \nmethods only.  \nWhy they special methods, because they just do one thing and that is getting and \nsetting private fields. \n \nFor example, here is an Employee class which have a field empExperience which is \nbasically employee experience.  \nRemember in C# when we say field then it represents the data only. \nThis field cannot be accessed from outside because it is a private field. \nWe have to create a public property “EmpExperience” which will wrap this field \nand then only this is accessible from outside this class. \nSo, see the definition again, encapsulation is wrapping of data which is field here \nand the function which is property here into a single unit.  \nWithout this wrapping this data or field should not be available outside this class.  \nSo this is encapsulation. \n \nNow you can see in the main method, we are accessing the property \nEmpExperience not the field so this is encapsulation.  \nIn short, field or data can be only accessed outside the class via the property only. \nWhy encapsulation required?  \nBecause here it is making your field or data secured as it is not directly accessible.  \nAnd via property you can put some additional logic with this field value like \nencryption/ decryption so it’s a kind of wrapper. \nViolating Encapsulation \n \nFor example, in this code, Employee class do not have any property.  \nSee there is no property in it.  \nAnd in main method field is accessed without property. \nIt will work but it is violating encapsulation concept of OOPS, which is not good as \nyour data and fields are exposed directly and it is not good for security. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n29"

    "question": "WHAT IS POLYMORPHISM AND WHAT ARE ITS TYPES?",
    "answer": " Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, object, or function to take on \nMULTIPLE FORMS.  \n \nWhat is multiple forms? \nFor example, in English “RUNNING” word can be used for “running a race” or \n“running a business”. In both cases the meaning is different but the name \n“RUNNING” is same. \nThis is multiple forms – where same name thing can be used for different \npurpose. \nMultiple forms can be achieved in C# via polymorphism. \nBelow you can see, two functions with same name “ADD” but having multiple \nforms, meaning both functions are doing different things, one is adding 2 integers \nother one is adding 2 strings. \nThis is one type of polymorphism, and the name of this type is method \noverloading. \nNow there are two types of polymorphism. Compile time and Run time.  \nOverloading is a type of Compile time polymorphism and Overriding is a type of \nrun time polymorphism.  \nCompile time means when you build your project then .NET framework started \nconverting your C# code into machine language and create a dll for that. This \nduration of conversion is compile time. \nNow when the build is complete and now you will run your project to see the \noutput then that duration is run time. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n32"

    "question": "WHEN TO USE INTERFACE AND WHEN ABSTRACT CLASS?",
    "answer": "Abstract class is a good choice when you are sure some methods are \nconcrete/defined and must be implemented in the SAME WAY in all derived \nclasses. \n \nFor example, here you can see we have an abstract class Employee. So whenever \nan employee is hired then might be the Project he is going to work with is not \nfixed. May be there are multiple projects in the company. \nBut the role of that employee is fixed based on the designation and the Role of \nEmployee here is Software Engineer which is kind of fixed. So, this Role method is \nconcrete and defined in advance. \nIn such scenario we prefer abstract classes where some methods are defined and \nsome just declared. \n \n \n  \n An interface is a good choice when you know a method has to be there, but \nit can be implemented DIFFERENTLY by independent derived classes. \n \nSee here we have the IEmployee interface in which we have two method \nProject and Manager and both are just declared. \nBecause these methods can vary for project to project. In one project the \nProject name and Manager name is different and for other project it can again \nbe different. \nSo these details are not fixed or concrete so we have just declared these \nmethods not defined it. \nThis is the use of interfaces. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNormally we prefer Interface because it gives use the flexibility to modify the \nbehavior at later stage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n40"

    "question": "WHY TO EVEN CREATE INTERFACES?",
    "answer": "There are two reasons to create interfaces: \n1. One is to achieve Multiple Inheritance in C#, as abstract classes do not support \nmultiple inheritance. \n2. Second reason is to maintain a consistency between different derived classes. \n \nSuppose we have an IT company and there are many Employees in it. \n \n \n \nSo, we will declare this interface for the Employee.  \nWhy to create interface, because every employee must have the Salary and the \nProject he will be working on.  \nAnd by inheriting this interface in the derived class we are making sure that all the \nmethods must be implemented. Since every method of interface must be \nimplemented in the derived class. Right now we have just two methods but we \nmight have many methods. \nSee, if we will create an PermanentEmployee class then by inheriting this interface \nwe are making sure that we are following the standard of the company and doing \nboth things. \nSetting salary and setting project. \n \n \n \nSimilarly, if we will create an another type of employee class, ContractEmployee \nclass then also by inheriting this interface we are following the contract. \n \nIn short here, consistency will be maintained through out the application for all \ntype of employee classes, and therefore the system or application can be easily \nmanaged. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n42"

In this \nmethod we will pass the value like 5 and it will get the last 5 characters of the \nstring. \nNow we need this method but .Net String class do not have any such method and \nwe even can’t add this method in the .Net class as String is a base class  library \nwhich code we can’t change. \nSo how to add this method now. \nThe answer is with the help of extension method. \n \n \n \nWe will create a static class StringExtension and will define a RightSubstring \nmethod inside it. This method will get the string “HelloWorld” in it’s parameter \nand one another parameter for the count which is 5 here.  \nThen inside the method you can write the logic for getting the right most 5 \ncharacters from the string. \nThat’s it, you have added a new method in String class without even modifying the \nString class. \nNow if you run this then the output will be Hello World. As the right string will be \nthe “World”. \n \n \n \n Now few important thing, extension method must be static because this will \nbe directly called from the class name, not by the object creation. \nAnd since the method is static therefore class StringExtesnions is also static. \n \n Second thing is, this keyword is used for binding this method with the String \nclass. \nIf you are creating the extension method of some other class, then you must \ngive the name of that class along with this keyword. \n \nUSE - Use them when you don’t have CODE of the class and you want to add a \nnew method in that class. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n82"

Task is created by Microsoft(.NET Framework) in order to \nwork easily with threads. \nTask internally uses Threads only. \n \nYou can also say that Thread is like a bicycle with which you can go anywhere, but \nit will need hard work and time. Whereas Task is like a motorcycle, it will also take \nyou to anywhere but with speed and easiness. \n \n \nBelow are some advantages of Tasks over Threads: \n A Task can RETURN A RESULT but there is no proper way to return a result \nfrom Thread. \n \n We can apply CHAINING on multiple tasks but we can not in threads. \n \n \n We can apply PARENT/CHILD relationship in Tasks.

    "answer": "140 \n \nBelow are the advantages of MVC: \n \n1. SOC (SEPARATION OF CONCERNS) - Separation of Concerns is one of the core \nadvantages of ASP.NET MVC. The MVC framework provides a clean separation of \nthe UI, Business Logic, Model or Data. \n Meaning is view is not dependent on controller and controller is not dependent on \nview. In Web forms one aspx file will have one aspx.cs file, which means UI(aspx) is \nTIGHTLY COUPLED with logic (.aspx.cs). \n \n2. MULTIPLE VIEW SUPPORT -  Due to the separation of the model from the view, \nthe user interface can display multiple views of the same data at the same time. \n  \n3. CHANGE ACCOMMODATION - User interfaces tend to change more frequently \nthan business rules (different colors, fonts, screen layouts, and levels of support \nfor new devices such as cell phones or PDAs) because the model does not depend \non the views, adding new types of views to the system generally does not affect \nthe model. As a result, the scope of change is confined to the view. \nIn Web forms one aspx file will have one aspx.cs file, which means UI(aspx) is \nTIGHTLY COUPLED with logic (.aspx.cs). \n \nIn MVC one view can interact with multiple controllers and one controller can \ninteract with multiple views therefore no TIGHT coupling. \n \n4. MORE CONTROL - The ASP.NET MVC framework provides more control over \nHTML, JavaScript, and CSS than the traditional Web Forms.  \n \n5. TESTABILITY - ASP.NET MVC framework provides better testability of the Web \nApplication and good support for test driven development too. \n6. LIGHTWEIGHT - ASP.NET MVC framework doesn’t use View State and thus \nreduces the bandwidth of the requests to an extent. \n \n7. FULL FEATURES OF ASP.NET - One of the key advantages of using ASP.NET MVC \nis that it is built on top of the ASP.NET framework and hence most of the features \nof the ASP.NET like membership providers, roles, etc can still be used. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n142"

    "answer": "RESPONSE.REDIRECT()? \n \nBoth Response.Redirect() and Server.Transfer() methods are used to  redirect the \nuser's browser from one page to another page. \n \nResponse.Redirect uses round trip back to the client for redirecting the page.  \nIt is a slow technique, but it maintains the URL history in the client browser for all \npages. \n \nSuppose a client will send a request for Page1.aspx to the server. See this \nPage1.aspx present on the server. Now inside this Page1.aspx after some logic it \nhas to be redirected to the Page2.aspx on some condition. So if you are using the \nresponse.redirect, then it will send the response back to the client and then it will \nagain request the new page from the server. So, this is what we also call round \ntrip, when you are going from position A to B and then you have to go to position \nC, for that you are coming back to position A and then going to position C, that is \nround trip which is not good and slow. \nIn Server.Transfer page processing transfers from one page to the other page \nWITHOUT MAKING A ROUND-TRIP BACK to the client's browser.  \nIt is a faster technique, but it does not maintain the URL history in the client \nbrowser for all pages. \nIn case of Server.Transfer transfer from Page1 to 2 will be direct without going \nback to the client like this.

You will add a new else if condition at the end. Right? \n \nSo basically, Inserting one more else if{} will violate the open closed principle \nbecause you are modifying the class rather than extending it. \n \n \n \nSo how to follow Open Closed Principle? \nInheritance is the way of extending the functionality of an existing class. \nFor that you have to change your design of your application. \nFirst create an interface ISavingAccount in which just declare CalculateInterest() \nmethod. After that, create a class for RegularSavingAccount and then inherit it \nfrom ISavingAccount class. Now implement CalculateInterest() method inside it. \nSimilarly create a separate class for SalarySvaingAccount and then add a new \nclass for BussinessSavingAccount to extend the SavingAccount functionality which \nwill be then extension not modification. \n \n \nSee if you want to add any account then you need not to modify the class but you \ncan add a new class and achieve that. \n \n\n  \n176"

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CLASS AND AN OBJECT? \na) Class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created.  \nb) Object is an instance of a class. \n \na) Class is a group of similar objects. \nb) Object is a real world entity such as pen, laptop, mobile, bed, keyboard, \nmouse, chair etc. \n \na) Class is a logical entity. \nb) Object is a physical entity. \n \n \n \n3. WHAT IS POLYMORPHISM? WHAT IS STATIC AND DYNAMIC POLYMORPHISM \nPolymorphism refers to the ability to exist in multiple forms. Multiple \ndefinitions can be given to a single interface. For example, if you have a class \nnamed Vehicle, it can have a method named speed but you cannot define it \nbecause different vehicles have different speed. This method will be defined in \nthe subclasses with different definitions for different vehicles. \nStatic polymorphism (static binding) is a kind of polymorphism that occurs at \ncompile time. An example of compile-time polymorphism is method \noverloading. \nRuntime polymorphism or dynamic polymorphism (dynamic binding) is a type \nof polymorphism which is resolved during runtime. An example of runtime \npolymorphism is method overriding. \n \n \n \n4. WHAT IS OPERATOR OVERLOADING? \nOperator overloading refers to implementing operators using user-defined \ntypes based on the arguments passed along with it. \n \n \n5. CAN YOU CALL THE BASE CLASS METHOD WITHOUT CREATING AN INSTANCE?  \n   Yes, you can call the base class without instantiating it if: \n It is a static method. \n The base class is inherited by some other subclass. \n \n \n6. WHAT ARE VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS AND PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS? \nVirtual functions are functions that are present in the parent class and are \noverridden by the subclass. These functions are used to achieve runtime \npolymorphism. \nPure virtual functions or abstract functions are functions that are only declared \nin the base class. This means that they do not contain any definition in the \nbase class and need to be redefined in the subclass. \n \n \n7. WHAT IS A DESTRUCTOR? \nA destructor is a method that is automatically invoked when an object is \ndestroyed. The destructor also recovers the heap space that was allocated to \nthe destroyed object, closes the files and database connections of the object, \netc. \n \n \n8. WHAT IS A COPY CONSTRUCTOR? \nA copy constructor creates objects by copying variables from another object of \nthe same class. The main aim of a copy constructor is to create a new object \nfrom an existing one. \n \n \n9. DO WE REQUIRE A PARAMETER FOR CONSTRUCTORS? \nNo, we do not need a parameter for constructors. \n \n \n10. WHICH OOPS CONCEPT EXPOSES ONLY THE NECESSARY INFORMATION TO \nTHE CALLING FUNCTIONS? \nEncapsulation \n11. IS IT ALWAYS NECESSARY TO CREATE OBJECTS FROM CLASS? \nNo, it is possible to call a base class method if it is defined as a static method. \n \n \n12. WHAT IS EARLY AND LATE BINDING? \nEarly binding refers to the task of values to variables during plan time, whereas \nlate Binding refers to the assignment of values to variables during run time. \n \n \n \n13. WHICH OOPS CONCEPT IS USED AS A REUSE MECHANISM?  \nInheritance is the OOPS concept that can be used as a reuse mechanism. \nC# \n \n1. IN TRY BLOCK IF WE ADD RETURN STATEMENT WHETHER FINALLY BLOCK IS \nEXECUTED?  \nYes. Finally block will still be executed in presence of return statement in try \nblock. \n \n \n  \n2. WHAT YOU MEAN BY INNER EXCEPTION? \nInner exception is a property of exception class which will give you a brief insight \nof the exception i.e, parent exception and child exception details. \n \n \n \n  \n3. LIST OUT SOME OF THE EXCEPTIONS? \nBelow are some of the exceptions - \n NullReferenceException \n ArgumentNullException \n DivideByZeroException \n IndexOutOfRangeException \n InvalidOperationException \n StackOverflowException etc. \n4. EXPLAIN HASHTABLE? HOW TO CHECK WHETHER HASH TABLE CONTAINS \nSPECIFIC KEY? \nIt is used to store the key/value pairs based on hash code of the key. Key will be \nused to access the element in the collection. For example, \nHashtable myHashtbl = new Hashtable(); \nmyHashtbl.Add(\"1\", \"TestValue1\"); \nmyHashtbl.Add(\"2\", \"TestValue2\"); \n \nMethod – “ContainsKey” can be used to check the key in hash table. Below is the \nsample code for the same – \nEg: myHashtbl.ContainsKey(\"1\"); \n \n \n5. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIST AND DICTIONARY? \nList collection is a generic class and can store any data types to create a list. It only \ncontains value not key. \nDictionary is a collection of keys and values in C#. Dictionary<TKey, TValue> is \nincluded in the System.Collection.Generics namespace. \n \n \n6. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STACK AND QUEUE COLLECTIONS? \nA stack is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted and deleted \nonly from one side of the list, called the top. A stack follows the LIFO (Last In First \nOut) principle, i.e., the element inserted at the last is the first element to come \nout. \nA queue is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted only from \none side of the list called rear, and the elements can be deleted only from the \nother side called the front. The queue data structure follows the FIFO (First In \nFirst Out) principle, i.e. the element inserted at first in the list, is the first element \nto be removed from the list. \n \n \n7. EXPLAIN JAGGED ARRAYS? \nIf the elements of an array is an array then it’s called as jagged array. The \nelements can be of different sizes and dimensions. \n \n \n8. EXPLAIN MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAYS? \nA multi-dimensional array in C# is an array that contains more than one rows to \nstore the data. The multidimensional array can be declared by adding commas in \nthe square brackets. \n \n \n9. EXPLAIN INDEXERS? \nIndexers are used for allowing the classes to be indexed like arrays. Indexers will \nresemble the property structure but only difference is indexer’s accessors will \ntake parameters. For example, \nclass MyCollection<T> \n{ \n private T[] myArr = new T[100]; \n public T this[int t] \n { \n get \n { \n return myArr[t]; \n } \n set \n { \n myArr[t] = value; \n } \n } \n} \n \n \n10. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN METHODS – “SYSTEM.ARRAY.CLONE()” \nAND “SYSTEM.ARRAY.COPYTO()”? \n “CopyTo()” method can be used to copy the elements of one array to other.  \n “Clone()” method is used to create a new array to contain all the elements \nwhich are in the original array. \n \n \n11. EXPLAIN NAMESPACES? \nNamespaces are containers for the classes. We will use namespaces for grouping \nthe related classes. “Using” keyword can be used for using the namespace in \nother namespace. \n \n \n12. WHAT ARE VALUE TYPE AND REFERENCE TYPES? \nValue types stored in a stack.  \nHere are the value types: \n Decimal, int, byte, enum, double, long, float \nReference types are stored in a heap. \nBelow are the list of reference types - \n Class, string, interface, object \n13. CAN WE OVERRIDE PRIVATE VIRTUAL METHOD? \nNo. We can’t override private virtual methods as it is not accessible outside the \nclass. \n \n \n14. EXPLAIN CIRCULAR REFERENCE? \nThis is a situation where in, multiple resources are dependent on each other and \nthis causes a lock condition and this makes the resource to be unused. \n \n \n15. EXPLAIN OBJECT POOL? \nObject pool is used to track the objects which are being used in the code. So \nobject pool reduces the object creation overhead. \n \n \n16. WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF DELEGATES? \nBelow are the uses of delegates - \n Single Delegate \n Multicast Delegate \n Generic Delegate \n \n \n17. WHAT ARE THE THREE TYPES OF GENERIC DELEGATES? \nBelow are the three types of generic delegates - \n Func \n Action \n Predicate \n \n \n18. WHAT ARE THE USES OF DELEGATES?  \nBelow are the list of uses of delegates - \n Callback Mechanism \n Asynchronous Processing \n Abstract and Encapsulate method \n Multicasting \n \n \n19. CAN WE USE DELEGATES FOR ASYNCHRONOUS METHOD CALLS? \n \nYes. We can use delegates for asynchronous method calls. \n \n \n \n20. WHAT IS AN ESCAPE SEQUENCE? NAME SOME STRING ESCAPE SEQUENCES \nIN C#. \nAn Escape sequence is denoted by a backslash (\\). The backslash indicates that \nthe character that follows it should be interpreted literally or it is a special \ncharacter. An escape sequence is considered as a single character. \n21. WHAT ARE REGULAR EXPRESSIONS? \nRegular expression is a template to match a set of input. The pattern can consist \nof operators, constructs or character literals. Regex is used for string parsing and \nreplacing the character string. \n \n \n22. WHY TO USE LOCK STATEMENT? \nLock will make sure one thread will not intercept the other thread which is \nrunning the part of code. So lock statement will make the thread wait, block till \nthe object is being released. \n \n \n23. WHAT IS “EXTERN” KEYWORD? \nThe extern modifier is used to declare a method that is implemented externally. \nA common use of the extern modifier is with the DllImport attribute when \nyou are using Interop services to call into unmanaged code. \n[DllImport(\"avifil32.dll\")] \nprivate static extern void AVIFileInit(); \n \n \n24. WHAT IS “SIZEOF” OPERATOR? \nThe sizeof operator returns the number of bytes occupied by a variable of a given \ntype. The argument to the sizeof operator must be the name of an unmanaged \ntype or a type parameter that is constrained to be an unmanaged type. \nConsole.WriteLine(sizeof(byte));  // output: 1 \n25. WHAT IS TERNARY OPERATOR? \nThe conditional operator ?:, also known as the ternary conditional operator, \nevaluates a Boolean expression and returns the result of one of the two \nexpressions, depending on whether the Boolean expression evaluates to true or \nfalse. \ncondition ? consequent : alternative \n \n \n26. CAN WE USE “THIS” INSIDE A STATIC METHOD? \nNo. We can’t use “this” in static method. \n \n \n27. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CTYPE AND DIRECTCAST? \n CType is used for conversion between type and the expression. \n Directcast is used for converting the object type which requires run time \ntype to be the same as specified type. \n \n \n28. WHICH STRING METHOD IS USED FOR CONCATENATION OF TWO STRINGS? \n“Concat” method of String class is used to concatenate two strings. For example, \nstring.Concat(firstStr, secStr) \n \n \n29. WHAT IS PARSING? HOW TO PARSE A DATE TIME STRING? \nParsing converts a string into another data type. \nFor Example: \nstring text = “500”; \nint num = int.Parse(text); \n500 is an integer. So, the Parse method converts the string 500 into its own base \ntype, i.e int. \nFollow the same method to convert a DateTime string. \nstring dateTime = “Jan 1, 2018”; \nDateTime parsedValue = DateTime.Parse(dateTime); \n \n \n30. EXPLAIN PARTIAL CLASS? \nPartial classes concept added in .Net Framework 2.0 and it allows us to split the \nbusiness logic in multiple files with the same class name along with “partial” \nkeyword. \n \n \n31. EXPLAIN ANONYMOUS TYPE? \nThis is being added 3.0 version. This feature enables us to create an object at \ncompile time. Below is the sample code for the same – \nVar myTestCategory = new { CategoryId = 1, CategoryName = “Category1”}; \n \n \n32. EXPLAIN GET AND SET ACCESSOR PROPERTIES? \nGet and Set are called Accessors. These are made use by Properties. The property \nprovides a mechanism to read, write the value of a private field. For accessing \nthat private field, these accessors are used. \nGet Property is used to return the value of a property \nSet Property accessor is used to set the value. \n33. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VAR AND DYNAMIC IN C#?  \nVAR TYPE - VAR are those variables which are declared without specifying the \n.NET type explicitly. In implicitly typed variable, the type of the variable is \nautomatically deduced at compile time by the compiler from the value used to \ninitialize the variable. \nvar a = 'f'; \nDYNAMIC TYPE - It is used to avoid the compile-time type checking. The compiler \ndoes not check the type of the dynamic type variable at compile time, instead of \nthis, the compiler gets the type at the run time. The dynamic type variable is \ncreated using dynamic keyword. \ndynamic val1 = \"Interview\"; \n \n \n34. WHAT IS COVARIANCE IN C#? \nCovariance enables you to pass a derived type where a base type is expected. \nSmall sml = new Bigger(); \n.NET FRAMEWORK \n \n \n1. WHAT IS JIT? \nJIT stands for Just In Time. JIT is a compiler that converts Intermediate Language \nto a Native code. \nThe code is converted into Native language during execution. Native code is \nnothing but hardware specifications that can be read by the CPU. The native code \ncan be stored so that it is accessible for subsequent calls. \n \n \n2. WHAT IS MSIL? \nMSIL stands for Microsoft Intermediate Language. \nMSIL provides instructions for calling methods, initializing and storing values, \noperations such as memory handling, exception handling and so on. All .Net codes \nare first compiled to IL. \n \n \n3. WHAT IS MEANT BY MANAGED AND UNMANAGED CODE? \nThe code that is managed by the CLR is called Managed code. This code runs \ninside the CLR. Hence, it is necessary to install the .Net framework in order to \nexecute the managed code. CLR manages the memory through garbage collection \nand also uses the other features like CAS and CTS for efficient management of the \ncode. \nUnmanaged code is any code that does not depend on CLR for execution. It \nmeans it is developed by any other language independent of .Net framework. It \nuses its own runtime environment for compiling and execution. \nThough it is not running inside the CLR, the unmanaged code will work properly if \nall the other parameters are correctly followed. \n \n \n4. WHAT IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NAMESPACE AND ASSEMBLY? \nFollowing are the differences between namespace and assembly: \n• Assembly is physical grouping of logical units, Namespace, logically groups \nclasses. \n• Namespace can span multiple assembly. \n \n5. WHAT IS MANIFEST? \nAssembly metadata is stored in Manifest. Manifest contains all the metadata \nneeded to do the \nfollowing things (See Figure Manifest View for more details): \n• Version of assembly. \n• Security identity. \n• Scope of the assembly. \n• Resolve references to resources and classes. \n \n \n6. WHERE IS VERSION INFORMATION STORED OF AN ASSEMBLY? \nVersion information is stored in assembly inside the manifest. \n7. IS VERSIONING APPLICABLE TO PRIVATE ASSEMBLIES? \nVersioning concept is only applicable to global assembly cache (GAC) as private \nassembly lie in \ntheir individual folders. This does not mean versioning is not needed , you can still \nversion it to \nhave better version control on the project. \n \n \n8. WHAT IS THE APPLICATION DOMAIN? \nAn Application Domain is a logical container for a set of assemblies in which an \nexecutable is hosted. As you have seen, a single process may contain multiple \nApplication Domains, each of which is hosting a .NET executable.  \n \n \n9. EXPLAIN CAS (CODE ACCESS SECURITY). \n.Net provides a security model that prevents unauthorized access to resources. \nCAS is a part of that security model. CAS is present in the CLR. It enables the users \nto set permissions at a granular level for the code. \n \n \n10. WHAT IS THE USE OF ‘FINALIZE’? \nFinalize as an object method used to free up unmanaged resources and cleanup \nbefore Garbage Collection(GC). It performs memory management tasks. \n (THREADING) \n11.  WHAT ARE SYNCHRONOUS AND ASYNCHRONOUS OPERATIONS?  \n1. Synchronization is a way to create a thread-safe code where only one thread \ncan access the resource at any given time. The asynchronous call waits for \nthe method to complete before continuing with the program flow. \n2. Synchronous programming badly affects the UI operations when the user \ntries to perform time-consuming operations since only one thread will be \nused. In Asynchronous operation, the method call will immediately return so \nthat the program can perform other operations while the called method \ncompletes its work in certain situations. \n \n \n12. WHAT IS MULTI-TASKING? \nIt is a feature of modern operating systems with which we can run multiple \nprograms at same \ntime example Word, Excel etc. \n \n \n13. NAME SOME PROPERTIES OF THREAD CLASS. \nFew Properties of thread class are: \n IsAlive – contains value True when a thread is Active. \n Name – Can return the name of the thread. Also, can set a name for the \nthread. \n Priority – returns the prioritized value of the task set by the operating \nsystem. \n IsBackground – gets or sets a value which indicates whether a thread \nshould be a background process or foreground. \n ThreadState– describes the thread state. \n14. WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT STATES OF A THREAD? \nDifferent states of a thread are: \n Unstarted – Thread is created. \n Running – Thread starts execution. \n WaitSleepJoin – Thread calls sleep, calls wait on another object and calls \njoin on another thread. \n Suspended – Thread has been suspended. \n Aborted – Thread is dead but not changed to state stopped. \n Stopped – Thread has stopped. \n \n \n15. CAN WE HAVE MULTIPLE THREADS IN ONE APP DOMAIN? \nOne or more threads run in an AppDomain. An AppDomain is a runtime \nrepresentation of a \nlogical process within a physical process. Each AppDomain is started with a single \nthread, but \ncan create additional threads from any of its threads. \n \n \n16. WHICH NAMESPACE HAS THREADING? \n‘Systems.Threading’ has all the classes related to implement threading. \n \n \n17. EXPLAIN LOCK, MONITORS, AND MUTEX OBJECT IN THREADING. \nLock keyword ensures that only one thread can enter a particular section of the \ncode at any given time. In the above Example, lock(ObjA) means the lock is placed \non ObjA until this process releases it, no other thread can access ObjA. \nMutex is also like a lock but it can work across multiple processes at a time. \nWaitOne() is used to lock and ReleaseMutex() is used to release the lock. But \nMutex is slower than lock as it takes time to acquire and release it. \nMonitor.Enter and Monitor.Exit implements lock internally. a lock is a shortcut for \nMonitors. lock(objA) internally calls. \nMonitor.Enter(ObjA); \ntry \n{ \n} \nFinally {Monitor.Exit(ObjA));} \n \n \n \n18. WHAT IS THREAD.SLEEP () IN THREADING? \nThread's execution can be paused by calling the Thread.Sleep method. This \nmethod takes an \ninteger value that determines how long the thread should sleep. Example \nThread.CurrentThread.Sleep(2000). \n \n \n \n19. WHAT IS SUSPEND AND RESUME IN THREADING? \nSuspend() method is called to suspend the thread. Resume() method is called to \nresume the suspended thread. Start() method is used to send a thread into runnable \nState. \n \n20. WHAT THE WAY TO STOP A LONG RUNNING THREAD? \nThread.Abort() stops the thread execution at that moment itself. \n \n \n21. WHY WE NEED MULTI-THREADING IN OUR PROJECT? \nMulti-threading is running the multiple threads simultaneously. Some main \nadvantages are: \n You can do multiple tasks simultaneously. For e.g. saving the details of user \nto a file while at the same time retrieving something from a web service. \n Threads are much lightweight than process. They don't get their own \nresources. They used the resources allocated to a process. \n Context-switch between threads takes less time than process. \n \n \n22. HOW TO START A THREAD IN C#? \nWe have to use the Thread class provided by System.Threading namespace. In the \nconstructor of the class, we have to pass the method name which we want to run \nin separate thread. After than we have to call the start method of Thread class. \nBelow is the example. \n \n \n \n \n23. WHAT IS RACE CONDITION? \nA race condition happens when two or more threads want to update shared data \nat the same time. \n \n \n24. WHAT IS LIVELOCK? \nA livelock is very similar to deadlock except involved threads states are continually \nchanging their state but still they cannot complete their work. \nA real-world example of livelock occurs when two people meet in a narrow \ncorridor, and each tries to be polite by moving aside to let the other pass, but \nthey end up swaying from side to side without making any progress because they \nboth repeatedly move the same way at the same time. \n \n \n25. WHAT IS IMMUTABLE OBJECT?  \nAn immutable object is an object which states cannot be changed after creation.  \nImmutable objects are useful in concurrent programming as they are thread-safe. \n\"String\" objects are examples of immutable object because we can cannot change \nthe value of string after it is created.  \n \n \n26. HOW MANAGED CODE IS EXECUTED? \nManaged code is a code whose execution is managed by Common Language \nRuntime. It gets the managed code and compiles it into machine code. After that, \nthe code is executed. The runtime here i.e. CLR provides automatic memory \nmanagement, type safety, etc. \n27. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SYSTEM EXCEPTIONS AND APPLICATION \nEXCEPTIONS? \nIn general System exceptions occurred whenever some non-recoverable or fatal \nerror is encountered, like a database crash, bound errors etc. \nWhile in case of Application level exceptions some error which is recoverable is \nencountered, for instance, the wrong type of input data, arithmetic exceptions \netc. \n \n \n28. WHAT IS XSD? \nXSD (XML Schema Definition), a recommendation of the World Wide Web \nConsortium (W3C), specifies how to formally describe the elements in an \nExtensible Markup Language (XML) document. It can be used by programmers to \nverify each piece of item content in a document. \nASP.NET MVC \n \n1. IN WHICH ASSEMBLY IS THE MVC FRAMEWORK DEFINED? \nSystem.Web.Mvc \n \n \n2. IS IT POSSIBLE TO SHARE A VIEW ACROSS MULTIPLE CONTROLLERS? \nYes, put the view into the shared folder. This will automatically make the view \navailable across multiple controllers. \n \n \n \n3. WHAT IS ROUTE IN MVC? WHAT IS DEFAULT ROUTE IN MVC? \n  \nA route is a URL pattern that is mapped to a handler. The handler can be a \nphysical file, such as a .aspx file in a Web Forms application. A handler can also be \na class that processes the request, such as a controller in an MVC application. To \ndefine a route, you create an instance of the Route class by specifying the URL \npattern, the handler, and optionally a name for the route. \n  \nYou add the route to the application by adding the Route object to the static \nRoutes property of the RouteTable class. The Routesproperty is a RouteCollection \nobject that stores all the routes for the application. \n  \nYou typically do not have to write code to add routes in an MVC application. \nVisual Studio project templates for MVC include preconfigured URL routes. These \nare defined in the MVC Application class, which is defined in the Global.asax file. \nDefault Route \n  \nThe default ASP.NET MVC project templates add a generic route that uses the \nfollowing URL convention to break the URL for a given request into three named \nsegments. \n  \nURL: \"{controller}/{action}/{id}\" \n  \nThis route pattern is registered via a call to the MapRoute() extension method of \nRouteCollection. \n  \n \n \n \n4. WHERE ARE THE ROUTING RULES DEFINED IN AN ASP.NET MVC \nAPPLICATION? \nIn Application_Start event in Global.asax \n \n \n \n5. WHAT IS VALIDATION SUMMARY IN MVC?  \n The ValidationSummary helper method generates an unordered list (ul element) \nof validation messages that are in the ModelStateDictionary object. \n  \nThe ValidationSummary can be used to display all the error messages for all the \nfields. It can also be used to display custom error messages.  \n  \n \n6. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RAZOR AND ASPX VIEW ENGINE IN MVC? \n Razor View Engine VS ASPX View Engine \nThe Razor View Engine is a bit slower than the ASPX View Engine. \n  \nConclusion \n  \nRazor provides a new view engine with a streamlined code for focused \ntemplating. Razor's syntax is very compact and improves the readability of the \nmarkup and code. By default, MVC supports ASPX (web forms) and Razor View \nEngine. MVC also supports third-party view engines like Spark, Nhaml, NDjango, \nSharpDOM and so on. ASP.NET MVC is open source. \n \n \n   \n7. WHAT ARE THE MAIN RAZOR SYNTAX RULES? \n  \n Razor code blocks are enclosed in @{ ... } \n Inline expressions (variables and functions) start with @ \n Code statements end with semicolon \n Variables are declared with the var keyword \n Strings are enclosed with quotation marks \n C# code is case sensitive \n C# files have the extension .cshtml \n  \n \n8. HOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT FORMS AUTHENTICATION IN MVC? \n   \nAuthentication is giving access to the user for a specific service by verifying \nhis/her identity using his/her credentials like username and password or email \nand password. It assures that the correct user is authenticated or logged in for a \nspecific service and the right service has been provided to the specific user based \non their role that is nothing but authorization. \n  \nASP.NET forms authentication occurs after IIS authentication is completed. You \ncan configure forms authentication by using forms element with in web.config file \nof your application. The default attribute values for forms authentication are \nshown below, \n<system.web>   \n    <authenticationmode=\"Forms\">   \n        <formsloginUrl=\"Login.aspx\" protection=\"All\" timeout=\"30\" name=\n\".ASPXAUTH\" path=\"/\" requireSSL=\"false\" slidingExpiration=\"true\" defa\nultUrl=\"default.aspx\" cookieless=\"UseDeviceProfile\" enableCrossApp\nRedirects=\"false\" />   \n        </authentication>   \n</system.web>   \nThe FormsAuthentication class creates the authentication cookie automatically \nwhen SetAuthCookie() or RedirectFromLoginPage() methods are called. The value \nof authentication cookie contains a string representation of the encrypted and \nsigned FormsAuthenticationTicket object. \n9. HOW WE CAN REGISTER THE AREA IN ASP.NET MVC? \nWhen we have created an area make sure this will be registered in \n“Application_Start” event in Global.asax. Below is the code snippet where area \nregistration is done : \nprotected void Application_Start() \n{ \nAreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas(); \n} \n \n \n10. EXPLAIN THE NEED OF DISPLAY MODE IN MVC? \n  \nDisplayModes give you another level of flexibility on top of the default capabilities \nwe saw in the last section. DisplayModes can also be used along with the previous \nfeature so we will simply build off of the site we just created. \n  \nUsing display modes involves in 2 steps \n1. We should register Display Mode with a suffix for particular browser using \n“DefaultDisplayMode”e class inApplication_Start() method in the \nGlobal.asax file. \n2. View name for particular browser should be appended with suffix mentioned \nin first step. \n  \n1. Desktop browsers (without any suffix. e.g.: Index.cshtml, _Layout.cshtml). \n2. Mobile browsers (with a suffix “Mobile”. e.g.: \nIndex.Mobile.cshtml,Layout.Mobile.cshtml) \n  \nIf you want design different pages for different mobile device browsers (any \ndifferent browsers) and render them depending on the browser requesting. To \nhandle these requests you can register custom display modes. We can do that \nusing DisplayModeProvider.Instance.Modes.Insert(int index, IDisplayMode item) \nmethod. \n  \n \n11. WHAT IS ROUTE CONSTRAINTS IN MVC? \n \nRouting is a great feature of MVC, it provides a REST based URL that is very easy \nto remember and improves page ranking in search engines. \nThis article is not an introduction to Routing in MVC, but we will learn a few \nfeatures of routing and by implementing them we can develop a very flexible and \nuser-friendly application. So, let's start without wasting valuable time. \n  \nAdd constraint to URL \n This is very necessary for when we want to add a specific constraint to our URL. \nSay, for example we want a URL. \n So, we want to set some constraint string after our host name. Fine, let's see how \nto implement it. \n It's very simple to implement, just open the RouteConfig.cs file and you will find \nthe routing definition in that. And modify the routing entry as in the following. We \nwill see that we have added “abc” before. \n  \n  \n \n  \nController name, now when we browse we need to specify the string in the URL, \nas in the following: \n12. WHAT ARE THE FOLDERS IN MVC APPLICATION SOLUTIONS? \n  \nUnderstanding the folders \n  \nWhen you create a project a folder structure gets created by default under the \nname of your project which can be seen in solution explorer. Below i will give you \na brief explanation of what these folders are for. \n  \nModel \n  \nThis folder contains classes that is used to provide data. These classes can contain \ndata that is retrived from the database or data inserted in the form by the user to \nupdate the database. \n  \nControllers \n  \nThese are the classes which will perform the action invoked by the user. These \nclasses contains methods known as \"Actions\" which responds to the user action \naccordingly. \n  \nViews \n  \nThese are simple pages which uses the model class data to populate the HTML \ncontrols and renders it to the client browser. \nApp_Start \n  \nContains Classes such as FilterConfig, RoutesConfig, WebApiConfig. As of now we \nneed to understand the RouteConfig class. This class contains the default format \nof the url that should be supplied in the browser to navigate to a specified page. \n  \n \n13. WHAT ARE THE METHODS OF HANDLING AN ERROR IN MVC? \n   \nException handling may be required in any application, whether it is a web \napplication or a Windows Forms application. \n  \nASP.Net MVC has an attribute called \"HandleError\" that provides built-in \nexception filters. The HandleError attribute in ASP.NET MVC can be applied over \nthe action method as well as Controller or at the global level. The HandleError \nattribute is the default implementation of IExceptionFilter. When we create a \nMVC application, the HandleError attribute is added within the Global.asax.cs file \nand registered in the Application_Start event. \n1. public static void RegisterGlobalFilters(GlobalFilterCollection filters) \n  \n2. {   \n3.     filters.Add(new HandleErrorAttribute());   \n4. }   \n5. protected void Application_Start()   \n6. {   \n7.     AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();   \n8.     RegisterGlobalFilters(GlobalFilters.Filters);   \n9.     RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes);   \n10. }   \nImportant properties of HandleError attribute \n  \nThe HandleError Error attribute has a couple for properties that are very useful in \nhandling the exception. \n  \nExceptionType \n  \nType of exception to be catch. If this property is not specified then the \nHandleError filter handles all exceptions. \n  \nView \n  \nName of the view page for displaying the exception information. \n  \nMaster \n  \nMaster View for displaying the exception. \n  \nOrder \n  \nOrder in which the action filters are executed. The Order property has an integer \nvalue and it specifies the priority from 1 to any positive integer value. 1 means \nhighest priority and the greater the value of the integer is, the lower is the priority \nof the filter. \n  \nAllowMultiple \nIt indicates whether more than one instance of the error filter attribute can be \nspecified. \n  \nExample \n[HandleError(View = \"Error\")]   \npublic class HomeController: Controller   \n{   \n    public ActionResult Index()   \n    {   \n        ViewBag.Message = \"Welcome to ASP.NET MVC!\";   \n        int u = Convert.ToInt32(\"\"); // Error line   \n        return View();   \n    }   \n}   \nHandleError Attribute at Action Method Level, \n[HandleError(View = \"Error\")]   \npublic ActionResult Index()   \n{   \n    ViewBag.Message = \"Welcome to ASP.NET MVC!\";   \n    int u = Convert.ToInt32(\"\"); // Error line   \n    return View();   \n}   \n14. WHAT IS VIEWSTART? \n  \nRazor View Engine introduced a new layout named _ViewStart which is applied on \nall view automatically. Razor View Engine firstly executes the _ViewStart and then \nstart rendering the other view and merges them. \n  \nExample of Viewstart \n@ {   \n    Layout = \"~/Views/Shared/_v1.cshtml\";   \n} < !DOCTYPE html >   \n    < html >   \n    < head >   \n    < meta name = \"viewport\"   \ncontent = \"width=device-width\" / >   \n    < title > ViewStart < /title> < /head> < body >   \n    < /body> < /html>   \n  \n \n15. HOW TO USE VIEWBAG? \n  \nViewBag is dynamic property that takes advantage of new dynamic features in C# \n4.0. It's also used to pass data from a controller to a view. In short, The ViewBag \nproperty is simply a wrapper around the ViewData that exposes the ViewData \ndictionary as a dynamic object. Now create an action method \"StudentSummary\" \nin the \"DisplayDataController\" controller that stores a Student class object in \nViewBag. \n1. public ActionResult StudentSummary()   \n2. {   \n3.     var student = new Student()   \n4.     {   \n5.         Name = \"Sandeep Singh Shekhawat\",   \n6.             Age = 24,   \n7.             City = \"Jaipur\"   \n8.     };   \n9.     ViewBag.Student = student;   \n10.     return View();   \n11. }   \nThereafter create a view StudentSummary (\"StudentSummary.cshtml\") that \nshows student object data. ViewBag does not require typecasting for complex \ndata type so you can directly access the data from ViewBag. \n1. @ {   \n2.     ViewBag.Title = \"Student Summary\";   \n3.     var student = ViewBag.Student;   \n4. }    \n5. < table >   \n6.     < tr >   \n7.     < th > Name < /th> < th > Age < /th> < th > City < /th> < /tr> < tr >   \n8.     < td > @student.Name < /td> < td > @student.Age < /td> < td > @student\n.City < /td> < /tr>    \n9. < /table>   \nHere we used one more thing, \"ViewBag.Title\", that shows the title of the page.  \n \n \n  \n16. HOW CAN WE DONE CUSTOM ERROR PAGE IN MVC? \n  \nThe HandleErrorAttribute allows you to use a custom page for this error. First you \nneed to update your web.config file to allow your application to handle custom \nerrors. \n1. <system.web>   \n2.     <customErrors mode=\"On\">   \n3. </system.web>   \nThen, your action method needs to be marked with the atttribute. \n1. [HandleError]   \n2. public class HomeController: Controller   \n3. {   \n4.     [HandleError]   \n5.     publicActionResultThrowException()   \n6.     {   \n7.         throw new ApplicationException();   \n8.     }   \n9. }   \nBy calling the ThrowException action, this would then redirect the user to the \ndefault error page. In our case though, we want to use a custom error page and \nredirect the user there instead.So, let's create our new custom view page. \nNext, we simply need to update the HandleErrorAttribute on the action method. \n1. [HandleError]   \n2. public class HomeController: Controller    \n3. {   \n4.     [HandleError(View = \"CustomErrorView\")]   \n5.     publicActionResultThrowException()    \n6.     {   \n7.         throw new ApplicationException();   \n8.     }   \n9. }    \n17. WHAT IS SERVER SIDE VALIDATION IN MVC? \n  \n  \nThe ASP.NET MVC Framework validates any data passed to the controller action \nthat is executing, It populates a ModelState object with any validation failures \nthat it finds and passes that object to the controller. Then the controller actions \ncan query the ModelState to discover whether the request is valid and react \naccordingly. \n  \nI will use two approaches in this article to validate a model data. One is to \nmanually add an error to the ModelState object and another uses the Data \nAnnotation API to validate the model data. \n  \nApproach 1 - Manually Add Error to ModelState object \n  \nI create a User class under the Models folder. The User class has two properties \n\"Name\" and \"Email\". The \"Name\" field has required field validations while the \n\"Email\" field has Email validation. So let's see the procedure to implement the \nvalidation. Create the User Model as in the following, \n1. namespace ServerValidation.Models   \n2. {   \n3.     public class User    \n4.     {   \n5.         public string Name   \n6.       {   \n7.             get;   \n8.             set;   \n9.         }   \n10.         public string Email   \n11.         {   \n12.             get;   \n13.             set;   \n14.         }   \n15.     }   \n16. }   \nAfter that I create a controller action in User Controller (UserController.cs under \nControllers folder). That action method has logic for the required validation for \nName and Email validation on the Email field. I add an error message on \nModelState with a key and that message will be shown on the view whenever the \ndata is not to be validated in the model. \n1. using System.Text.RegularExpressions;   \n2. using System.Web.Mvc;   \n3. namespace ServerValidation.Controllers    \n4. {   \n5.     public class UserController: Controller   \n6.     {   \n7.         public ActionResult Index()    \n8.         {   \n9.                 return View();   \n10.             }   \n11.             [HttpPost]   \n12.         public ActionResult Index(ServerValidation.Models.User model)   \n13.         {   \n14.              \n15.             if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(model.Name))   \n16.             {   \n17.                 ModelState.AddModelError(\"Name\", \"Name is required\");   \n18.             }   \n19.             if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(model.Email))   \n20.             {   \n21.                 string emailRegex = @ \"^([a-zA-Z0-9_\\-\\.]+)@((\\[[0-\n9]{1,3}\" +   \n22.                     @ \"\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.)|(([a-zA-Z0-9\\-\n]+\\\" +   \n23.                 @ \".)+))([a-zA-Z]{2,4}|[0-9]{1,3})(\\]?)$\";   \n24.                 Regex re = new Regex(emailRegex);   \n25.                 if (!re.IsMatch(model.Email))   \n26.                 {   \n27.                     ModelState.AddModelError(\"Email\", \"Email is not val\nid\");   \n28.                 }   \n29.             } else {   \n30.                 ModelState.AddModelError(\"Email\", \"Email is required\")\n;   \n31.             }   \n32.             if (ModelState.IsValid)    \n33.             {   \n34.                 ViewBag.Name = model.Name;   \n35.                 ViewBag.Email = model.Email;   \n36.             }   \n37.             return View(model);   \n38.         }   \n39.     }   \n40. }   \nThereafter I create a view (Index.cshtml) for the user input under the User folder. \n1. @model ServerValidation.Models.User   \n2. @ {   \n3.     ViewBag.Title = \"Index\";   \n4. }   \n5. @using(Html.BeginForm())    \n6. {   \n7.     if (@ViewData.ModelState.IsValid)   \n8.         {   \n9.         if (@ViewBag.Name != null)   \n10.     { < b >   \n11.                 Name: @ViewBag.Name < br / >   \n12.                 Email: @ViewBag.Email < /b>   \n13.         }   \n14.     } < fieldset >   \n15.         < legend > User < /legend>  < div class = \"editor-label\" >   \n16.         @Html.LabelFor(model => model.Name) < /div> < div class = \"edi\ntor-field\" >   \n17.         @Html.EditorFor(model => model.Name)   \n18.     @if(!ViewData.ModelState.IsValid)  \n19. {  \n20. < span class = \"field-validation-\nerror\" > @ViewData.ModelState[\"Name\"].Errors[0].ErrorMessage < /spa\nn>    \n21.          \n22. }  \n23. < /div>  < div class = \"editor-label\" >   \n24.   \n25.         @Html.LabelFor(model => model.Email) < /div> < div class = \"edi\ntor-field\" >   \n26.         @Html.EditorFor(model => model.Email)   \n27.     @if(!ViewData.ModelState.IsValid) \n28.  { \n29. < span class = \"field-validation-\nerror\" > @ViewData.ModelState[\"Email\"].Errors[0].ErrorMessage < /sp\nan>    \n30.   }       \n31.  < /div> < p >   \n32.         < input type = \"submit\"   \n33.     value = \"Create\" / >   \n34.         < /p> < /fieldset>   \n35. }   \n \n \n18. WHAT IS THE USE OF REMOTE VALIDATION IN MVC? \n  \nRemote validation is the process where we validate specific data posting data to a \nserver without posting the entire form data to the server. Let's see an actual \nscenario, in one of my projects I had a requirement to validate an email address, \nwhetehr it already exists in the database. Remote validation was useful for that; \nwithout posting all the data we can validate only the email address supplied by \nthe user. \n  \nPractical Explanation \n  \nLet's create a MVC project and name it accordingly, for me its \n“TestingRemoteValidation”. Once the project is created let's create a model \nnamed UserModel that will look like: \n1. public class UserModel    \n2. {   \n3.     [Required]   \n4.     public string UserName    \n5.     {   \n6.         get;   \n7.         set;   \n8.     }   \n9.     [Remote(\"CheckExistingEmail\", \"Home\", ErrorMessage = \"Email \nalready exists!\")]   \n10.     public string UserEmailAddress   \n11.     {   \n12.         get;   \n13.         set;   \n14.     }   \n15. }   \nLet's get some understanding of the remote attribute used, so the very first \nparameter “CheckExistingEmail” is the the name of the action. The second \nparameter “Home” is referred to as controller so to validate the input for the \nUserEmailAddress the “CheckExistingEmail” action of the “Home” controller is \ncalled and the third parameter is the error message. Let's implement the \n“CheckExistingEmail” action result in our home controller. \n1. public ActionResult CheckExistingEmail(string UserEmailAddress)   \n2. {   \n3.     bool ifEmailExist = false;   \n4.     try   \n5.     {   \n6.         ifEmailExist = UserEmailAddress.Equals(\"mukeshknayak@gmail.c\nom\") ? true : false;   \n7.         return Json(!ifEmailExist, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);   \n8.     } catch (Exception ex)   \n9.     {   \n10.         return Json(false, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);   \n11.     }   \n12. }   \n  \n \n19. EXPLAIN RENDERSECTION IN MVC? \n  \nRenderSection() is a method of the WebPageBase class. Scott wrote at one point, \nThe first parameter to the \"RenderSection()\" helper method specifies the name of \nthe section we want to render at that location in the layout template. The second \nparameter is optional, and allows us to define whether the section we are \nrendering is required or not. If a section is \"required\", then Razor will throw an \nerror at runtime if that section is not implemented within a view template that is \nbased on the layout file (that can make it easier to track down content errors). It \nreturns the HTML content to render. \n1. <div id=\"body\">   \n2.     @RenderSection(\"featured\", required: false)   \n3.     <section class=\"content-wrapper main-content clear-\nfix\">   \n4.         @RenderBody()   \n5.     </section>   \n6. </div>   \n20. WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF NONACTIONATTRIBUTE? \nIn general, all public methods of a controller class are treated as action methods. \nIf you want prevent this default behavior, just decorate the public method with \nNonActionAttribute. \n \n \n21. HOW ROUTE TABLE IS CREATED IN ASP.NET MVC? \nWhen an MVC application first starts, the Application_Start() method is called. \nThis method, in turn, calls the RegisterRoutes() method. The RegisterRoutes() \nmethod creates the route table. \n \n \n22. ASP.NET MVC APPLICATION, MAKES USE OF SETTINGS AT 2 PLACES FOR \nROUTING TO WORK CORRECTLY. WHAT ARE THESE 2 PLACES? \n1. Web.Config File : ASP.NET routing has to be enabled here. \n2. Global.asax File : The Route table is created in the application Start event \nhandler, of the Global.asax file. \n \n23. WHAT IS THE USE OF THE FOLLOWING DEFAULT ROUTE? \n{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo} \nThis route definition, prevent requests for the Web resource files such as \nWebResource.axd or ScriptResource.axd from being passed to a controller. \n \n \n24. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ADDING ROUTES, TO A WEBFORMS \nAPPLICATION AND TO AN MVC APPLICATION? \nTo add routes to a webforms application, we use MapPageRoute() method of the \nRouteCollection class, where as to add routes to an MVC application we use \nMapRoute() method. \n \n \n25. IF I HAVE MULTIPLE FILTERS IMPLEMENTED, WHAT IS THE ORDER IN WHICH \nTHESE FILTERS GET EXECUTED?  \n1. Authorization filters \n2. Action filters \n3. Response filters \n4. Exception filters \n \n \n26. WHICH FILTER EXECUTES FIRST IN AN ASP.NET MVC APPLICATION? \nAuthorization filter \n \n \n27. WHAT ARE THE LEVELS AT WHICH FILTERS CAN BE APPLIED IN AN ASP.NET \nMVC APPLICATION? \n1. Action Method \n2. Controller \n3. Application \n \n \n28. IS IT POSSIBLE TO CREATE A CUSTOM FILTER? \nYes \n29. WHAT FILTERS ARE EXECUTED IN THE END? \nException Filters \n \n \n30. IS IT POSSIBLE TO CANCEL FILTER EXECUTION? \nYes \n \n \n31. WHAT TYPE OF FILTER DOES OUTPUTCACHEATTRIBUTE CLASS REPRESENTS? \nResult Filter \n \n \n32. WHAT ARE THE 2 POPULAR ASP.NET MVC VIEW ENGINES? \n1. Razor \n2. .aspx \n \n \n33. WHAT SYMBOL WOULD YOU USE TO DENOTE, THE START OF A CODE BLOCK \nIN RAZOR VIEWS? \n@ \n \n \n34. WHAT SYMBOL WOULD YOU USE TO DENOTE, THE START OF A CODE BLOCK \nIN ASPX VIEWS? \n<%= %> \nIn razor syntax, what is the escape sequence character for @ symbol? \nThe escape sequence character for @ symbol, is another @ symbol \n \n \n35. WHAT ARE SECTIONS? \nLayout pages, can define sections, which can then be overriden by specific views \nmaking use of the layout. Defining and overriding sections is optional. \n \n \n36. WHAT ARE THE FILE EXTENSIONS FOR RAZOR VIEWS? \n1. .cshtml – If the programming lanugaue is C# \n2. .vbhtml – If the programming lanugaue is VB \n \n \n37. HOW DO YOU SPECIFY COMMENTS USING RAZOR SYNTAX? \nRazor syntax makes use of @* to indicate the begining of a comment and *@ to \nindicate the end. \n \n \n38. IS IT POSSIBLE TO COMBINE ASP.NET WEBFORMS AND ASP.MVC AND \nDEVELOP A SINGLE WEB APPLICATION? \nYes, it is possible to combine ASP.NET webforms and ASP.MVC and develop a \nsingle web application. \n39. WHAT IS THE USE OF VIEWMODEL IN MVC? \nViewModel is a plain class with properties, which is used to bind it to strongly \ntyped view. ViewModel can have the validation rules defined for its properties \nusing data annotations. \n \n \n40. EXPLAIN BUNDLE.CONFIG IN MVC4? \n“BundleConfig.cs” in MVC4 is used to register the bundles by the bundling and \nminification system. Many bundles are added by default including jQuery libraries \nlike – jquery.validate, Modernizr, and default CSS references. \n \n41. HOW WE CAN HANDLE THE EXCEPTION AT CONTROLLER LEVEL IN ASP.NET \nMVC? \nException Handling is made simple in ASP.Net MVC and it can be done by just \noverriding “OnException” and set the result property of the filtercontext object \n(as shown below) to the view detail, which is to be returned in case of exception. \nprotected overrides void OnException(ExceptionContext filterContext) \n{ \n} \n \n \n42. DOES TEMPDATA HOLD THE DATA FOR OTHER REQUEST IN ASP.NET MVC? \nIf Tempdata is assigned in the current request then it will be available for the \ncurrent request and the subsequent request and it depends whether data in \nTempData read or not. If data in Tempdata is read then it would not be available \nfor the subsequent requests. \n43. EXPLAIN KEEP METHOD IN TEMPDATA IN ASP.NET MVC? \nAs explained above in case data in Tempdata has been read in current request \nonly then “Keep” method has been used to make it available for the subsequent \nrequest. \n@TempData[“TestData”]; \nTempData.Keep(“TestData”); \n \n \n44. EXPLAIN PEEK METHOD IN TEMPDATA IN ASP.NET MVC? \nSimilar to Keep method we have one more method called “Peek” which is used \nfor the same purpose. This method used to read data in Tempdata and it \nmaintains the data for subsequent request. \nstring A4str = TempData.Peek(“TT”).ToString(); \n \n \n45. WHAT ARE CHILD ACTIONS IN ASP.NET MVC? \nTo create reusable widgets child actions are used and this will be embedded into \nthe parent views. In ASP.Net MVC Partial views are used to have reusability in the \napplication. Child action mainly returns the partial views. \n \n \n46. EXPLAIN THE TOOLS USED FOR UNIT TESTING IN ASP.NET MVC? \nBelow are the tools used for unit testing : \nNUnit \nxUnit.NET \nNinject 2 \nMoq \n47. CAN I USE RAZOR CODE IN JAVASCRIPT IN ASP.NET MVC? \nYes. We can use the razor code in javascript in cshtml by using <text> element. \n< script type=”text/javascript”> \n@foreach (var item in Model) { \n< text > \n//javascript goes here which uses the server values \n< text > \n} \n< script> \n \n \n48. HOW CAN I RETURN STRING RESULT FROM ACTION IN ASP.NET MVC? \nBelow is the code snippet to return string from action method : \npublic ActionResult TestAction() { \nreturn Content(“Hello Test !!”); \n} \n \n \n49. HOW TO RETURN THE JSON FROM ACTION METHOD IN ASP.NET MVC? \nBelow is the code snippet to return string from action method : \npublic ActionResult TestAction() { \nreturn JSON(new { prop1 = “Test1”, prop2 = “Test2” }); \n} \n50. GIVE AN EXAMPLE FOR AUTHORIZATION FILTERS IN AN ASP.NET MVC \nAPPLICATION?  \n1. RequireHttpsAttribute \n2. AuthorizeAttribute \n \n \n \n51. WHAT IS DATA ANNOTATION VALIDATOR ATTRIBUTES IN MVC?  \nData Annotations are nothing but certain validations that we put in our models to \nvalidate the input from the user. ASP.NET MVC provides a unique feature in which \nwe can validate the models using the Data Annotation attribute. Import the \nfollowing namespace to use data annotations in the application. \nExample \n[Required(ErrorMessage = \"Please enter name\"), MaxLength(30)]   \n[Display(Name = \"Student Name\")]   \n \n public string Name { get; set; }   \n \n \n52. WHAT ARE THE EXCEPTION FILTERS IN MVC? \nException filter in MVC provides an ability to handle the exceptions for all the \ncontroller methods at a single location. This is by creating a class, which inherits \nfrom the FilterAttribute and IExceptionFilter interface. \n53. WHICH APPROACH PROVIDES BETTER SUPPORT FOR TEST DRIVEN \nDEVELOPMENT – ASP.NET MVC OR ASP.NET WEBFORMS? \nASP.NET MVC \nASP.NET WEBFORMS \n \n \n1. WHAT'S THE USE OF RESPONSE.OUTPUT.WRITE()? \nWe can write formatted output using Response.Output.Write(). \n \n \n2.

WHICH VALIDATOR CONTROL YOU USE IF YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THE \nVALUES IN TWO DIFFERENT CONTROLS MATCHED? \nCompare Validator control. \n \n \n5. WHAT IS VIEWSTATE? \nViewState is used to retain the state of server-side objects between page post \nbacks. \n6. HOW LONG THE ITEMS IN VIEWSTATE EXISTS? \nThey exist for the life of the current page. \n \n \n \n7. WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT VALIDATORS IN ASP.NET? \n1. Required field Validator \n2. Range Validator \n3. Compare Validator \n4. Custom Validator \n5. Regular expression Validator \n6. Summary Validator \n \n \n8. HOW YOU CAN ADD AN EVENT HANDLER? \nUsing the Attributes property of server side control. \ne.g. \nbtnSubmit.Attributes.Add(\"onMouseOver\",\"JavascriptCode();\") \n \n \n9. WHICH TYPE OF CACHING WILL BE USED IF WE WANT TO CACHE THE \nPORTION OF A PAGE INSTEAD OF WHOLE PAGE? \nFragment Caching: It caches the portion of the page generated by the request. \nFor that, we can create user controls with the below code: \n<%@ OutputCache Duration=\"120\" VaryByParam=\"CategoryID;SelectedID\"%> \n10. CAN WE HAVE A WEB APPLICATION RUNNING WITHOUT WEB.CONFIG FILE? \nYes \n \n \n11. CAN WE ADD CODE FILES OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IN APP_CODE \nFOLDER? \nNo. The code files must be in same language to be kept in App_code folder. \n \n \n12. WHAT IS PROTECTED CONFIGURATION? \nIt is a feature used to secure connection string information. \n \n \n13. WRITE CODE TO SEND E-MAIL FROM AN ASP.NET APPLICATION? \nMailMessage mailMess = new MailMessage (); \nmailMess.From = \"abc@gmail.com\"; \nmailMess.To = \"xyz@gmail.com\"; \nmailMess.Subject = \"Test email\"; \nmailMess.Body = \"Hi This is a test mail.\"; \nSmtpMail.SmtpServer = \"localhost\"; \nSmtpMail.Send (mailMess); \nMailMessage and SmtpMail are classes defined System.Web.Mail namespace. \n14. HOW CAN WE PREVENT BROWSER FROM CACHING AN ASPX PAGE? \nWe can SetNoStore on HttpCachePolicy object exposed by the Response object's \nCache property: \nResponse.Cache.SetNoStore (); \nResponse.Write (DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString ()); \n \n \n15. WHAT IS THE GOOD PRACTICE TO IMPLEMENT VALIDATIONS IN ASPX PAGE? \nClient-side validation is the best way to validate data of a web page. It reduces the \nnetwork traffic and saves server resources. \n \n \n16. WHAT ARE THE EVENT HANDLERS THAT WE CAN HAVE IN GLOBAL.ASAX \nFILE? \nApplication Events: Application_Start , Application_End, \nApplication_AcquireRequestState, Application_AuthenticateRequest, \nApplication_AuthorizeRequest, Application_BeginRequest, Application_Disposed, \nApplication_EndRequest, Application_Error, \nApplication_PostRequestHandlerExecute, \nApplication_PreRequestHandlerExecute,Application_PreSendRequestContent, \nApplication_PreSendRequestHeaders, Application_ReleaseRequestState, \nApplication_ResolveRequestCache, Application_UpdateRequestCache \nSession Events: Session_Start,Session_End \n17. WHICH PROTOCOL IS USED TO CALL A WEB SERVICE? \nHTTP Protocol \n \n \n18. EXPLAIN ROLE BASED SECURITY? \nRole Based Security used to implement security based on roles assigned to user \ngroups in the organization. \nThen we can allow or deny users based on their role in the organization. Windows \ndefines several built-in groups, including Administrators, Users, and Guests. \n<AUTHORIZATION>< authorization > \n< allow roles=\"Domain_Name\\Administrators\" / >   < !-- Allow Administrators in \ndomain. -- > \n< deny users=\"*\"  / >                            < !-- Deny anyone else. -- > \n< /authorization > \n \n \n19. HOW CAN WE APPLY THEMES TO AN ASP.NET APPLICATION? \nWe can specify the theme in web.config file. Below is the code example to apply \ntheme: \n<configuration> \n \n<system.web> \n<pages theme=\"Windows7\" /> \n</system.web> \n</configuration> \n \n \n20. WHAT IS REDIRECTPERMANENT IN ASP.NET? \nRedirectPermanent Performs a permanent redirection from the requested URL to \nthe specified URL. Once the redirection is done, it also returns 301 Moved \nPermanently responses. \n \n \n21. EXPLAIN THE WORKING OF PASSPORT AUTHENTICATION. \nFirst of all it checks passport authentication cookie. If the cookie is not available \nthen the application redirects the user to Passport Sign on page. Passport service \nauthenticates the user details on sign on page and if valid then stores the \nauthenticated cookie on client machine and then redirect the user to requested \npage \n \n \n22. WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF PASSPORT AUTHENTICATION? \nAll the websites can be accessed using single login credentials. So no need to \nremember login credentials for each web site. \nUsers can maintain his/ her information in a single location. \n \n \n23. WHAT ARE THE ASP.NET SECURITY CONTROLS? \n <asp:Login>: Provides a standard login capability that allows the users to \nenter their credentials \n <asp:LoginName>: Allows you to display the name of the logged-in user \n <asp:LoginStatus>: Displays whether the user is authenticated or not \n <asp:LoginView>: Provides various login views depending on the selected \ntemplate \n <asp:PasswordRecovery>: email the users their lost password \n \n \n24. HOW DO YOU REGISTER JAVASCRIPT FOR WEBCONTROLS ? \nWe can register javascript for controls using <CONTROL -\nname>Attribtues.Add(scriptname,scripttext) method. \n \n \n25. DIFFERENTIATE STRONG TYPING AND WEAK TYPING \nIn strong typing, the data types of variable are checked at compile time. On the \nother hand, in case of weak typing the variable data types are checked at runtime. \nIn case of strong typing, there is no chance of compilation error. Scripts use weak \ntyping and hence issues arises at runtime. \n \n \n26.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WEB CONFIG AND MACHINE CONFIG?  \nWeb config file is specific to a web application where as machine config is specific \nto a machine or server. There can be multiple web config files into an application \nwhere as we can have only one machine config file on a server. \nWeb config fields will override machine configurations. \n \n \n35. WHAT IS CROSS PAGE POSTING?  \nWhen we click submit button on a web page, the page post the data to the same \npage. The technique in which we post the data to different pages is called Cross \nPage posting. This can be achieved by setting POSTBACKURL property of the \nbutton that causes the postback. Findcontrol method of PreviousPage can be \nused to get the posted values on the page to which the page has been posted. \nADO.NET \n \n1. WHAT IS OBJECT POOLING? \nObject pooling is nothing but a repository of the objects in memory which can be \nused later. This object pooling reduces the load of object creation when it is \nneeded. Whenever there is a need of object, object pool manager will take the \nrequest and serve accordingly. \n \n \n2. WHAT IS CONNECTION POOLING? \nConnection pooling consists of database connection so that the connection can be \nused or reused whenever there is request to the database. This pooling technique \nenhances the performance of executing the database commands. This pooling \ndefinitely reduces our time and effort. \n \n \n \n3.

WHICH METHOD IS USED BY COMMAND CLASS TO EXECUTE SQL \nSTATEMENTS THAT RETURN SINGLE VALUE?  \nExecuteScalar \nJAVASCRIPT \n \n1. NAME THE TYPES OF FUNCTIONS IN JAVASCRIPT?  \nThe types of function are: \n Named - These type of functions contains name at the time of definition. For \nExample: \nfunction display()   \n{   \n  document.writeln(\"Named Function\");   \n}   \ndisplay();   \n \n Anonymous - These type of functions doesn't contain any name. They are \ndeclared dynamically at runtime. \nvar display=function()   \n{   \n  document.writeln(\"Anonymous Function\");   \n}   \ndisplay();   \n \n \n2. WHAT IS DOM? WHAT IS THE USE OF DOCUMENT OBJECT?  \nDOM stands for Document Object Model. A document object represents the \nHTML document. It can be used to access and change the content of HTML. \n3. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN == AND ===?  \nThe == operator checks equality only whereas === checks equality, and data type, \ni.e., a value must be of the same type. \n \n \n4. HOW TO WRITE HTML CODE DYNAMICALLY USING JAVASCRIPT?  \nThe innerHTML property is used to write the HTML code using JavaScript \ndynamically. Let's see a simple example: \ndocument.getElementById('mylocation').innerHTML=\"<h2>This is heading using J\navaScript</h2>\";    \n5. HOW TO CREATE OBJECTS IN JAVASCRIPT?  \nThere are 3 ways to create an object in JavaScript. \n1. By object literal \n2. By creating an instance of Object \n3. By Object Constructor \nLet's see a simple code to create an object using object literal. \nemp={id:102,name:\"Rahul Kumar\",salary:50000}    \n \n \n6. WHAT DOES THE ISNAN() FUNCTION?  \nThe isNan() function returns true if the variable value is not a number. For \nexample: \n \n \n7. HOW TO HANDLE EXCEPTIONS IN JAVASCRIPT?  \nBy the help of try/catch block, we can handle exceptions in JavaScript. JavaScript \nsupports try, catch, finally and throw keywords for exception handling. \ntry { \n  Block of code to try \n} \ncatch(err) { \n  Block of code to handle errors \n}  \nfinally { \n  Block of code to be executed regardless of the try / catch \nresult \n} \n8. WHAT IS THIS KEYWORD IN JAVASCRIPT?  \nThe this keyword is a reference variable that refers to the current object.  \nFor example: \nvar person = { \n  firstName: \"John\", \n  lastName : \"Doe\", \n  id       : 5566, \n  fullName : function() { \n    return this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName; \n  } \n};  \n \n \n9. WHAT IS THE USE OF DEBUGGER KEYWORD IN JAVASCRIPT?  \nJavaScript debugger keyword sets the breakpoint through the code itself. The \ndebugger stops the execution of the program at the position it is applied. Now, \nwe can start the flow of execution manually. If an exception occurs, the execution \nwill stop again on that particular line.. For example: \nvar x = 15 * 5; \ndebugger; \ndocument.getElementbyId(\"demo\").innerHTML = x; \n \n \n10. WHAT IS THE USE OF MATH OBJECT IN JAVASCRIPT?  \nThe JavaScript math object provides several constants and methods to perform a \nmathematical operation. Unlike date object, it doesn't have constructors.  \nFor example: \nMath.abs(-4.7);     // returns 4.7 \nMath.ceil(4.4);     // returns 5 \nMath.random();     // returns a random number \n \n \n \n11. DEFINE A NAMED FUNCTION IN JAVASCRIPT.  \nThe function which has named at the time of definition is called a named \nfunction. For example \n1. function msg()   \n2. {   \n3.   document.writeln(\"Named Function\");   \n4. }   \n5. msg();   \n \n \n12. WHAT IS THE USE OF WINDOW OBJECT?  \nThe window object is created automatically by the browser that represents a \nwindow of a browser. It is not an object of JavaScript. It is a browser object. \nThe window object is used to display the popup dialog box. Let's see with \ndescription. \nMethod Description \nalert() displays the alert box containing the message with ok button. \nconfirm() displays the confirm dialog box containing the message with ok and cancel button. \nprompt() displays a dialog box to get input from the user. \nopen() opens the new window. \nclose() closes the current window. \nsetTimeout() performs the action after specified time like calling function, evaluating expressions. \n \n \n \n13. DEFINE ANONYMOUS FUNCTION \nIt is a function that has no name. These functions are declared dynamically at \nruntime using the function operator instead of the function declaration. The \nfunction operator is more flexible than a function declaration. It can be easily \nused in the place of an expression. For example: \n1. var display=function()   \n2. {   \n3.   alert(\"Anonymous Function is invoked\");   \n4. }   \n5. display();   \n \n \n14. CAN AN ANONYMOUS FUNCTION BE ASSIGNED TO A VARIABLE? \nYes, you can assign an anonymous function to a variable. \n \n \n15. IN JAVASCRIPT WHAT IS AN ARGUMENT OBJECT? \nThe variables of JavaScript represent the arguments that are passed to a function. \n16. DEFINE CLOSURE. \nIn JavaScript, we need closures when a variable which is defined outside the \nscope in reference is accessed from some inner scope. \n1. var num = 10;   \n2. function sum()    \n3. {   \n4. document.writeln(num+num);   \n5. }    \n6. sum();   \n \n \n17. IF WE WANT TO RETURN THE CHARACTER FROM A SPECIFIC INDEX WHICH \nMETHOD IS USED? \nThe JavaScript string charAt() method is used to find out a char value present at \nthe specified index. The index number starts from 0 and goes to n-1, where n is \nthe length of the string. The index value can't be a negative, greater than or equal \nto the length of the string. For example: \n1. var str=\"Javatpoint\";     \n2. document.writeln(str.charAt(4));     \n \n \n18. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JAVASCRIPT AND JSCRIPT? \nNetscape provided the JavaScript language. Microsoft changed the name and \ncalled it JScript to avoid the trademark issue. In other words, you can say JScript is \nthe same as JavaScript, but Microsoft provides it. \n19. HOW TO USE EXTERNAL JAVASCRIPT FILE? \nI am assuming that js file name is message.js, place the following script tag inside \nthe head tag. \n1. <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"message.js\"></script>   \n \n \n20. WHAT IS THE USE OF HISTORY OBJECT? \nThe history object of a browser can be used to switch to history pages such as \nback and forward from the current page or another page. There are three \nmethods of history object. \n1. history.back() - It loads the previous page. \n2. history.forward() - It loads the next page. \n3. history.go(number) - The number may be positive for forward, negative for \nbackward. It loads the given page number. \n \n \n21. HOW TO CREATE A FUNCTION IN JAVASCRIPT? \nTo create a function in JavaScript, follow the following syntax. \n1. function function_name(){   \n2. //function body   \n3. }   \n \n \n22. WHAT ARE THE JAVASCRIPT DATA TYPES? \n \nThere are two types of data types in JavaScript: \n1. Primitive Data Types - The primitive data types are as follows: \nData Type Description \nString represents a sequence of characters, e.g., \"hello\" \nNumber represents numeric values, e.g., 100 \nBoolean represents boolean value either false or true \nUndefined represents an undefined value \nNull represents null, i.e., no value at all \n2. Non-primitive Data Types - The non-primitive data types are as follows: \nData Type Description \nObject represents an instance through which we can access members \nArray represents a group of similar values \nRegExp represents regular expression \n \n \n23. HOW TO WRITE NORMAL TEXT CODE USING JAVASCRIPT DYNAMICALLY? \nThe innerText property is used to write the simple text using JavaScript \ndynamically. Let's see a simple example: \n1. document.getElementById('mylocation').innerText=\"This is text using JavaS\ncript\";    \n24. HOW TO CREATE AN ARRAY IN JAVASCRIPT? \nThere are 3 ways to create an array in JavaScript. \n1. By array literal \n2. By creating an instance of Array \n3.

Search: <input type='text' name='query' />   \n3. <a href=\"javascript: submitform()\">Search</a>   \n4. </form>   \n5. <script type=\"text/javascript\">   \n6. function submitform()   \n7. {   \n8.   document.myform.submit();   \n9. }   \n10. </script>   \n27. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF A STRICT MODE IN JAVASCRIPT? \nThe JavaScript strict mode is used to generates silent errors. It provides \"use \nstrict\"; expression to enable the strict mode. This expression can only be placed as \nthe first statement in a script or a function. For example: \n1. \"use strict\";     \n2. x=10;     \n3. console.log(x);    \nSQL  \n \n1.  WHAT IS RDBMS? \nRDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS store the \ndata into the collection of tables, which is related by common fields between the \ncolumns of the table. It also provides relational operators to manipulate the data \nstored into the tables. \nExample: SQL Server. \n \n \n2. WHAT IS DENORMALIZATION. \nDeNormalization is a technique used to access the data from higher to lower \nnormal forms of database. It is also process of introducing redundancy into a \ntable by incorporating data from the related tables. \n \n \n3. WHAT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT NORMALIZATIONS? \nThe normal forms can be divided into 5 forms, and they are explained below -. \nFirst Normal Form (1NF):. \nThis should remove all the duplicate columns from the table. Creation of tables \nfor the related data and identification of unique columns. \nSecond Normal Form (2NF):. \nMeeting all requirements of the first normal form. Placing the subsets of data in \nseparate tables and Creation of relationships between the tables using primary \nkeys. \nThird Normal Form (3NF):. \nThis should meet all requirements of 2NF. Removing the columns which are not \ndependent on primary key constraints. \nFourth Normal Form (4NF):. \nMeeting all the requirements of third normal form and it should not have multi- \nvalued dependencies. \n \n \n \n4. WHAT IS A RELATIONSHIP AND WHAT ARE THEY? \nDatabase Relationship is defined as the connection between the tables in a \ndatabase. There are various data basing relationships, and they are as follows:. \n One to One Relationship. \n One to Many Relationship. \n Many to One Relationship. \n Self-Referencing Relationship. \n \n \n5. WHAT IS SUBQUERY? \nA subquery is a query within another query. The outer query is called as main \nquery, and inner query is called subquery. SubQuery is always executed first, and \nthe result of subquery is passed on to the main query. \n \n \n6. WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF SUBQUERY? \nThere are two types of subquery – Correlated and Non-Correlated. \nA correlated subquery cannot be considered as independent query, but it can \nrefer the column in a table listed in the FROM the list of the main query. \nA Non-Correlated sub query can be considered as independent query and the \noutput of subquery are substituted in the main query. \n \n \n7. WHAT IS A TRIGGER? \nA DB trigger is a code or programs that automatically execute with response to \nsome event on a table or view in a database. Mainly, trigger helps to maintain the \nintegrity of the database. \nExample: When a new student is added to the student database, new records \nshould be created in the related tables like Exam, Score and Attendance tables. \n \n \n8. WHAT ARE LOCAL AND GLOBAL VARIABLES AND THEIR DIFFERENCES? \nLocal variables are the variables which can be used or exist inside the function. \nThey are not known to the other functions and those variables cannot be referred \nor used. Variables can be created whenever that function is called. \nGlobal variables are the variables which can be used or exist throughout the \nprogram. Same variable declared in global cannot be used in functions. Global \nvariables cannot be created whenever that function is called. \n \n \n9. WHAT IS DATA INTEGRITY? \nData Integrity defines the accuracy and consistency of data stored in a database. \nIt can also define integrity constraints to enforce business rules on the data when \nit is entered into the application or database. \n10. WHAT IS AUTO INCREMENT? \nAuto increment keyword allows the user to create a unique number to be \ngenerated when a new record is inserted into the table. AUTO INCREMENT \nkeyword can be used in Oracle and IDENTITY keyword can be used in SQL SERVER. \nMostly this keyword can be used whenever PRIMARY KEY is used. \n \n \n11. WHAT IS DATAWAREHOUSE? \nDatawarehouse is a central repository of data from multiple sources of \ninformation. Those data are consolidated, transformed and made available for \nthe mining and online processing. Warehouse data have a subset of data called \nData Marts. \n \n \n12. WHAT IS CROSS-JOIN? \nCross join defines as Cartesian product where number of rows in the first table \nmultiplied by number of rows in the second table. If suppose, WHERE clause is \nused in cross join then the query will work like an INNER JOIN. \n \n \n \n13. WHAT IS COLLATION? \nCollation is defined as set of rules that determine how character data can be \nsorted and compared. This can be used to compare A and, other language \ncharacters and also depends on the width of the characters. \nASCII value can be used to compare these character data. \n14. WHAT ARE ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF COLLATION SENSITIVITY? \nFollowing are different types of collation sensitivity -. \n Case Sensitivity – A and a and B and b. \n Accent Sensitivity. \n Kana Sensitivity – Japanese Kana characters. \n Width Sensitivity – Single byte character and double byte character. \n \n \n15. ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF STORED PROCEDURE? \nStored procedure can be used as a modular programming – means create once, \nstore and call for several times whenever required. This supports faster execution \ninstead of executing multiple queries. This reduces network traffic and provides \nbetter security to the data. \nDisadvantage is that it can be executed only in the Database and utilizes more \nmemory in the database server. \n \n \n16. WHAT IS ONLINE TRANSACTION PROCESSING (OLTP)? \nOnline Transaction Processing (OLTP) manages transaction based applications \nwhich can be used for data entry, data retrieval and data processing. OLTP makes \ndata management simple and efficient. Unlike OLAP systems goal of OLTP systems \nis serving real-time transactions. \nExample – Bank Transactions on a daily basis. \n \n \n17. WHAT IS CLAUSE? \nSQL clause is defined to limit the result set by providing condition to the query. \nThis usually filters some rows from the whole set of records. \nExample – Query that has WHERE condition \nQuery that has HAVING condition. \n \n \n18. WHAT IS RECURSIVE STORED PROCEDURE? \nA stored procedure which calls by itself until it reaches some boundary condition. \nThis recursive function or procedure helps programmers to use the same set of \ncode any number of times. \n \n \n19. WHAT IS UNION, MINUS AND INTERACT COMMANDS? \nUNION operator is used to combine the results of two tables, and it eliminates \nduplicate rows from the tables. \nMINUS operator is used to return rows from the first query but not from the \nsecond query. Matching records of first and second query and other rows from \nthe first query will be displayed as a result set. \nINTERSECT operator is used to return rows returned by both the queries. \n \n \n20. WHAT IS AN ALIAS COMMAND? \nALIAS name can be given to a table or column. This alias name can be referred in \nWHERE clause to identify the table or column. \nExample-. \nSelect st.StudentID, Ex.Result from student st, Exam as Ex where st.studentID = \nEx. StudentID \nHere, st refers to alias name for student table and Ex refers to alias name for \nexam table. \n \n \n21. HOW CAN YOU CREATE AN EMPTY TABLE FROM AN EXISTING TABLE? \nExample will be -. \nSelect * into studentcopy from student where 1=2 \nHere, we are copying student table to another table with the same structure with \nno rows copied. \n \n \n22. HOW TO FETCH COMMON RECORDS FROM TWO TABLES? \nCommon records result set can be achieved by -. \nSelect studentID from student INTERSECT Select StudentID from Exam \n \n \n23. HOW TO FETCH ALTERNATE RECORDS FROM A TABLE? \nRecords can be fetched for both Odd and Even row numbers -. \nTo display even numbers-. \nSelect studentId from (Select rowno, studentId from student) where \nmod(rowno,2)=0 \nTo display odd numbers-. \nSelect studentId from (Select rowno, studentId from student) where \nmod(rowno,2)=1 \nfrom (Select rowno, studentId from student) where mod(rowno,2)=1.[/sql] \n \n \n24. HOW TO SELECT UNIQUE RECORDS FROM A TABLE? \nSelect unique records from a table by using DISTINCT keyword. \nSelect DISTINCT StudentID, StudentName from Student. \n \n \n25.

WHAT ARE AGGREGATE AND SCALAR FUNCTIONS?  \nAggregate functions are used to evaluate mathematical calculation and return \nsingle values. This can be calculated from the columns in a table. Scalar functions \nreturn a single value based on the input value. \nExample -. \nAggregate – max(), count - Calculated with respect to numeric. \nScalar – UCASE(), NOW() – Calculated with respect to strings. \n \n \n \n28. WHICH OPERATOR IS USED IN QUERY FOR PATTERN MATCHING?  \nLIKE operator is used for pattern matching, and it can be used as -. \n% - Matches zero or more characters. \n_(Underscore) – Matching exactly one character. \nExample -. \nSelect * from Student where studentname like 'a%' \nSelect * from Student where studentname like 'ami_' \n \n \n \n29. DEFINE MAGIC TABLES IN SQL SERVER?  \nA Table which is automatically created and managed by SQL server internally to \nstore the inserted, updated values for any DML (SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE, etc.) \noperation, is called as Magic tables in SQL server. The triggers preferably use it. \nDESIGN PATTERNS \n \n1. WHAT IS PROTOTYPE DESIGN PATTERN? \nPrototype Design patterns: \n Prototype pattern specifies the kind of objects to create using a prototypical \ninstance, and create new objects by copying this prototype. \n It is used to create a duplicate object or clone of the current object to \nenhance performance. \n  \n \n2. WHAT IS BUILDER DESIGN PATTERN? \nBuilder Design patterns: \n Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that \nthe same construction process can create different representations. \n In other words,you will have to design the system in such a way that the \nclient application will simply specify the parameters that should be used to \ncreate the complex object and the builder will take care of building the \ncomplex object. \n  \n \n3. WHAT IS ADAPTER DESIGN PATTERN? \nAdapter Design patterns: \n The adapter pattern is adapting between classes and objects \n \n This pattern involves a single class called adapter which is responsible for \ncommunication between two independent or incompatible interfaces \n \n This works like a bridge between two incompatible interfaces \n4. WHAT IS BRIDGE DESIGN PATTERN? \nBridge Design patterns: \n Bridge Pattern separates abstraction from its implementation, so that both \ncan be modified Independently \n \n Bridge Pattern behaves like a bridge between abstraction class and \nImplementer class. \n  \n \n5. WHAT IS COMPOSITE DESIGN PATTERN? \nComposite Design patterns: \n Composite pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent \npart as well as whole hierarchies. \n Composite pattern creates a class contains group of its own objects. This \nclass provides ways to modify its group of same objects. \n Composite pattern is used when we need to treat a group of objects and a \nsingle object in the same way \n \n \n6. WHAT IS DECORATOR DESIGN PATTERN? \nDecorator Design patterns: \n Decorator pattern is used to add new functionality to an existing object \nwithout changing its structure. \n Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclass for extending \nfunctionality. \n This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and add \nnew behaviors/operations to an object at run-time. \n7. WHAT IS FACADE DESIGN PATTERN? \nFacade Design patterns: \n Facade Design Pattern makes a software library easier to use, understand \nand test \n Facade Design Pattern make the library more readable \n Facade Design Pattern reduce dependencies of outside code on the inner \nworkings of a library \n Facade Design Pattern wrap a poorly designed collection of APIs with a \nsingle well-designed API. \n  \n \n8.  WHAT IS FLYWEIGHT DESIGN PATTERN? \nFlyweight Design patterns: \n Flyweight design pattern is an object that minimizes memory use by sharing \nas much data as possible with other similar objects \n Flyweight pattern is used to reduce the number of objects created, to \ndecrease memory and resource usage. As a result it increase performance \n Flyweight design pattern provides  a way to use objects in large numbers \nwhen a simple repeated representation would use an unacceptable amount of \nmemory. \n The flyweight pattern uses the concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic \ndata.Intrinsic datais held in the properties of the shared flyweight objects. \nThis information is stateless and generally remains unchanged, if any change \noccurs it would be reflected among all of the objects that reference the \nflyweight.Extrinsic data is computed on the fly means at runtime and it is \nheld outside of a flyweight object. Hence it can be stateful. \n9.  WHAT IS PROXY DESIGN PATTERN? \nProxy Design patterns: \n Proxy Design pattern involves a class, called proxy class, which represents \nfunctionality of another class. \n Proxy is a wrapper or agent object that is being called by the client to access \nthe real serving object behind the scenes. \nWEB API / WEB SERVICE / WCF \n \n1. IS IT RIGHT THAT ASP.NET WEB API HAS REPLACED WCF? \nIt's a not at all true that ASP.NET Web API has replaced WCF. In fact, it is another \nway of building non-SOAP based services, i.e., plain XML or JSON string. \n \n \n2. WEB API SUPPORTS WHICH PROTOCOL? \nWeb App supports HTTP protocol. \n \n \n3. WHICH .NET FRAMEWORK SUPPORTS WEB API? \nNET 4.0 and above version supports web API. \n \n \n4.

BY DEFAULT, WEB API SENDS HTTP RESPONSE WITH WHICH OF THE \nFOLLOWING STATUS CODE FOR ALL UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION? \n500 - Internal Server Error \n6.  WHAT IS WEB API ROUTING? \nRouting is pattern matching like in MVC. \nAll routes are registered in Route Tables. \nFor example: \nRoutes.MapHttpRoute( \n \nName: \"ExampleWebAPIRoute\", \n \nrouteTemplate: “api/{controller}/{id} \n \ndefaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional} \n \n \n7.  WHAT IS SOAP? \nSOAP is an XML message format used in web service interactions. It allows to \nsend messages over HTTP or JMS, but other transport protocols can be used. It is \nalso an XML-based messaging protocol for exchanging information among \ncomputers. \n \n \n8.  WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF USING REST IN WEB API? \nREST is used to make fewer data transfers between client and server which make \nit an ideal for using it in mobile apps. Web API also supports HTTP protocol. \nTherefore, it reintroduces the traditional way of the HTTP verbs for \ncommunication. \n9.  HOW CAN WE USE WEB API WITH ASP.NET WEB FORM? \nWeb API can be used with ASP.NET Web Form \nIt can be performed in three simple steps: \n1. Create a Web API Controller, \n2. Add a routing table to Application_Start method of Global.sax \n3. Then you need to make a jQuery AJAX Call to Web API method and get \ndata. \n \n \n10. HOW YOU CAN RETURN VIEW FROM ASP.NET WEB API METHOD? \nNo, we can't return a view from ASP.NET Web API Method. Web API creates HTTP \nservices that render raw data. However, it's also possible in ASP.NET MVC \napplication. \n \n \n11.  HOW TO REGISTER EXCEPTION FILTER GLOBALLY? \nIt is possible to register exception filter globally using following code- \nGlobalConfiguration.Configuration.Filters.Add(new \nMyTestCustomerStore.NotImplExceptionFilterAttribute()); \n \n \n \n12.  HOW CAN YOU RESTRICT ACCESS METHODS TO SPECIFIC HTTP VERBS IN \nWEB API? \nWith the help of Attributes (like HTTP verbs), It is possible to implement access \nrestrictions in Web API. \nIt is possible to define HTTP verbs as an attribute to restrict access. Example: \n[HttpPost] \n \npublic void Method1(Class obj) \n \n{ \n \n//logic \n \n \n \n13. WHO CAN CONSUME WEBAPI? \nWebAPI can be consumed by any client which supports HTTP verbs such as GET, \nPUT, DELETE, POST. As WebAPI services don’t need any configuration, they are \nvery easy to consume by any client. Infract, even portable devices like Mobile \ndevices can easily consume WebAPI which is certainly the biggest advantages of \nthis technology. \n \n \n14. WHAT ARE WEB SERVICES?  \nWeb services are open standard (XML, SOAP, HTTP etc.) based Web applications \nthat interact with other web applications for the purpose of exchanging data. \nWeb Services can convert your existing applications into Web-applications. \n \n \n15. WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF WEB SERVICES?  \nFollowing are the features of Web service − \n It is available over the Internet or private (intranet) networks. \n It uses a standardized XML messaging system. \n It is not tied to any one operating system or programming language. \n It is self-describing via a common XML grammar. \n It is discoverable via a simple find mechanism. \n \n \n16. WHAT THE COMPONENTS OF A WEB SERVICE?  \nThe basic web services platform is XML + HTTP. All the standard web services \nwork using the following components − \n SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) \n UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) \n WSDL (Web Services Description Language) \n \n \n17. HOW DOES A WEB SERVICE WORK?  \nA web service enables communication among various applications by using open \nstandards such as HTML, XML, WSDL, and SOAP. \nYou can also use C# to build new web services on Windows that can be invoked \nfrom your web application that is based on JavaServer Pages (JSP) and runs on \nLinux. \n \n \n18. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF XML IN A WEB SERVICE?  \nA web services takes the help of XML to tag the data, format the data. \n \n \n19. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF WEB SERVICES?  \nFollowing are the benefits of using web services − \n Exposing the Existing Function on the network − Web services allows you \nto expose the functionality of your existing code over the network. Once it is \nexposed on the network, other application can use the functionality of your \nprogram. \n Interoperability − Web services allow various applications to talk to each \nother and share data and services among themselves. \n Standardized Protocol − Web services use standardized industry standard \nprotocol for the communication. All the four layers (Service Transport, \nXML Messaging, Service Description, and Service Discovery layers) use \nwell-defined protocols in the web services protocol stack. \n Low Cost of Communication − Web services use SOAP over HTTP \nprotocol, so you can use your existing low-cost internet for implementing \nweb services. \n \n \n20. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY INTEROPERABILITY OF WEB SERVICES?  \nWeb services allow various applications to talk to each other and share data and \nservices among themselves. Other applications can also use the web services. For \nexample, a VB or .NET application can talk to Java web services and vice versa. \nWeb services are used to make the application platform and technology \nindependent. \n \n \n21. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY LOOSELY COUPLED ARCHITECTURE OF WEB \nSERVICES?  \nA consumer of a web service is not tied to that web service directly. The web \nservice interface can change over time without compromising the client's ability \nto interact with the service. A tightly coupled system implies that the client and \nserver logic are closely tied to one another, implying that if one interface changes, \nthe other must be updated. Adopting a loosely coupled architecture tends to \nmake software systems more manageable and allows simpler integration \nbetween different systems. \n \n \n22. WHAT IS HTTP?  \nHTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.Currently, HTTP is the most popular \noption for service transport. HTTP is simple, stable, and widely deployed. \nFurthermore, most firewalls allow HTTP traffic. This allows XML-RPC or SOAP \nmessages to masquerade as HTTP messages. \n \n \n23. WHAT IS WSDL?  \nWSDL is an XML-based language for describing web services and how to access \nthem. WSDL stands for Web Services Description Language. \n \n \n24. WHAT IS UDDI?  \nUDDI is an XML-based standard for describing, publishing, and finding web \nservices. UDDI stands for Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration. \n \n \n25. EXPLAIN WHAT IS WCF? \nWCF (Windows Communication Framework) is Microsoft framework to make \ninter-process communication easier.  Through various means, it lets you do the \ncommunication like MS messaging Queuing, Services, Remoting and so on.  It also \nallows you talk with other.NET apps, or non-Microsoft technologies (like J2EE). \n26. MENTION WHAT ARE THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF WCF? \nMain components of WCF are \n Service:  The working logic \n Host: The path where the data is saved. E.g., .exe, process, windows service \n Endpoints: The way the service is exposed to the outside world \n \n \n \n27. EXPLAIN HOW DOES WCF WORKS? \nWCF follows the “Software as a Service” model, where all units of functionality \nare defined as services.  For communication, each point is a portal or connection \neither with the client or other services. It is a program that exposes a collection of \nendpoints. \n \n \n28. EXPLAIN WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ASMX WEB SERVICES AND \nWCF? \nThe difference between WCF and ASMX or ASP.net web service is that ASMX is \ndesigned to send and receive messages using SOAP over HTTP only. While the \nWCF can exchange messages using any format over any transport protocol. \n \n \n26. MENTION WHAT IS THE ENDPOINT IN WCF AND WHAT ARE THE THREE \nMAJOR POINTS IN WCF? \nEvery service must have an address that determines where the service is located, \ncontract that defines what the service does and binding that tells how to \ncommunicate with the service. \n Address: It specifies the location of the service which will be like \nhttp://Myserver/Myservice.  To communicate with our service client it will \nuse this location \n Contract: It specifies the interface between the server and client. It’s a \nsimple interface with some attribute \n Binding: It decides how two parties will communicate with each other in \nterms of transport and encoding and protocols \n \n \n27. EXPLAIN HOW MANY TYPES OF CONTRACT DOES WCF DEFINES? \nWCF defines four types of Contracts \n Service Contracts \n Data Contracts \n Fault Contracts \n Message Contracts \n \n \n28.WHAT ARE THE TRANSPORT SCHEMAS DOES WCF SUPPORTS? \nIt supports \n HTTP \n TCP \n Peer network \n IPC ( Inter Process Communication) \n MSMQ \n \n \n29. MENTION WHAT ARE THE WAYS OF HOSTING A WCF SERVICE? \nThe ways of hosting a WCF service are \n IIS \n Self-Hosting \n WAS (Windows Activation Service) \n \n \n30. MENTION THE ADDRESS SYNTAX AND THE DIFFERENT FORMATS OF WCF \nTRANSPORT SCHEME? \nAddress syntax of WCF transport scheme is \n[transport]:// [machine or domain] [: optional port] format \n \n \n31. IN WCF WHAT ARE DUPLEX CONTRACTS? \nDuplex messaging or call-back is used in WCF to communicate with the client. \nOver different transport system Duplex messaging in WCF is done like TCP, \nNamed pipe and even HTTP.  Collectively this is known as duplex contracts in \nWCF. \n \n \n32. MENTION WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT INSTANCE MODES IN WCF? \nTo a particular service instance WCF binds an incoming message request, so the \navailable modes are \n Per Call: This instance is created for each call, efficient in terms of memory \nbut need to maintain session \n Per Session: For a complete session of a user instance are created \n Single: One instance is created which is shared among all the users and \nshared among all.  In terms of memory it is least efficient. \n33. EXPLAIN WHAT IS SOA? \nSOA (Service Oriented Architectural) is a collection of services that determines \nhow two computing entities will communicate with each other to achieve certain \nbusiness functionality and also how one entity can work on behalf of another \nentity. \n \n \n34. WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF DATA CONTRACTS IN WCF? \nThere are two types of Data Contracts \n Data Contract: Attribute used to define the class \n Data Member: Attribute used to define the properties \n \n \n35. WHAT ARE THE THREE TYPES OF TRANSACTION MANAGER WCF SUPPORTS? \nThe types of the transaction manager that WCF supports are \n Light Weight \n WS- Atomic Transaction \n OLE Transaction \n \n36.  NAME THE NAMESPACE THAT IS USED TO ACCESS WCF SERVICE? \nSystem.ServiceModel is used to access WCF service \n \n \n \n37. WHAT IS SOA STANDS FOR? \nService Oriented Architecture \n38. WHAT IS WCF STANDS FOR? \nWindows Communication Foundation. \n.NET CORE \n \n1. EXPLAIN THE MIDDLEWARE IN ASP.NET CORE? \nThe Request handling pipeline is a sequence of middleware components where \neach component performs the operation on request and either call the next \nmiddleware component or terminate the request. When a middleware \ncomponent terminates the request, it's called Terminal Middleware as It \nprevents next middleware from processing the request. You can add a \nmiddleware component to the pipeline by calling .Use... extension method as \nbelow. \n \n    app.UseHttpsRedirection(); \n    app.UseStaticFiles(); \n    app.UseRouting(); \nSo Middleware component is program that's build into an app's pipeline to \nhandle the request and response. Each middleware component can decide \nwhether to pass the request to next component and to perform any operation \nbefore or after next component in pipeline. \n \n \n2. WHAT IS REQUEST DELEGATE? \nRequest delegates handle each HTTP request and are used to build request \npipeline. It can configured using Run, Map and Use extension methods. An \nrequest delegate can be a in-line as an anonymous method (called in-line \nmiddleware) or a reusable class. These classes or in-line methods are called \nmiddleware components. \n3. WHAT IS HOST IN ASP.NET CORE? \nHost encapsulates all the resources for the app. On startup, ASP.NET Core \napplication creates the host. The Resources which are encapsulated by the host \ninclude: \n HTTP Server implementation \n Dependency Injection \n Configuration \n Logging \n Middleware components \n \n \n4. DESCRIBE THE GENERIC HOST AND WEB HOST? \nThe host setup the server, request pipeline and responsible for app startup and \nlifetime management. There are two hosts: \n.NET Generic Host \nASP.NET Core Web Host \n.NET Generic Host is recommended and ASP.NET Core template builds a .NET \nGeneric Host on app startup. \nASP.NET Core Web host is only used for backwards compatibility. \n \n// Host creation \npublic class Program \n{ \n    public static void Main(string[] args) \n    { \n        CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build().Run(); \n    } \n    public static IWebHostBuilder \nCreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) => \n        WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args) \n            .UseStartup(); \n} \n \n \n5. DESCRIBE THE SERVERS IN ASP.NET CORE? \nServer is required to run any application. ASP.NET Core provides an in-process \nHTTP server implementation to run the app. This server implementation listen for \nHTTP requests and surface them to the application as a set of request features \ncomposed into an HttpContext. \nASP.NET Core use the Kestrel web server by default. ASP.NET Core comes with: \n Default Kestrel web server that's cross platform HTTP server \nimplementation. \n IIS HTTP Server that's in-process server for IIS. \n HTTP.sys server that's a Windows-only HTTP server and it's based on the \nHTTP.sys kernel driver and HTTP Server API. \n \n \n \n6. HOW CONFIGURATION WORKS IN ASP.NET CORE? \nIn ASP.NET Core, Configuration is implemented using various configuration \nproviders. Configuration data is present in the form of key value pairs that can be \nread by configuration providers as key value from different configuration sources \nas below. \n appsettings.json - settings file \n Azure Key Vault \n Environment variables \n In-memory .Net objects \n Command Line Arguments \n Custom Providers \nBy default apps are configured to read the configuration data from \nappsettings.json, environment variables, command line arguments etc. While \nreading the data, values from environment variables override appsettings.json \ndata values. 'CreateDefaultBuilder' method provide default configuration. \n \n \n7. HOW TO READ VALUES FROM APPSETTINGS.JSON FILE? \nYou can read values from appsettings.json using below code. \n \nclass Test{ \n// requires using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration; \n private readonly IConfiguration Configuration; \n    public TestModel(IConfiguration configuration) \n    { \n        Configuration = configuration; \n    } \n// public void ReadValues(){ \nvar val = Configuration[\"key\"]; // reading direct key values \nvar name = Configuration[\"Employee:Name\"]; // read complex \nvalues \n} \n} \nDefault configuration provider first load the values from appsettings.json and \nthen from appsettings.Environment.json file. \nEnvironment specific values override the values from appsettings.json file. In \ndevelopment environment appsettings.Development.json file values override the \nappsettings.json file values, same apply to production environment. \n \n \n8. WHAT IS THE OPTIONS PATTERN IN ASP.NET CORE? \nOptions Pattern allow you to access related configuration settings in Strongly \ntyped way using some classes. When you are accessing the configuration settings \nwith the isolated classes, The app should adhere these two principles. \n Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) or Encapsulation: The class the \ndepend on the configurations, should depend only on the configuration \nsettings that they use. \n Separation of Concerns: Settings for different classes should not be related \nor dependent on one another. \n \n \n9. HOW TO USE MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTS IN ASP.NET CORE? \nASP.NET Core use environment variables to configure application behavior based \non runtime environment. launchSettings.json file \nsets ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT to Development on local Machine.   \n \n \n10. HOW ROUTING WORKS IN ASP.NET CORE? \nRouting is used to handle incoming HTTP requests for the app. Routing find \nmatching executable endpoint for incoming requests. These endpoints are \nregistered when app starts. Matching process use values from incoming request \nurl to process the requests. You can configure the routing in middleware pipeline \nof configure method in startup class. \n \n    app.UseRouting(); // It adds route matching to middlware \npipeline \n    // It adds endpoints execution to middleware pipeline \n    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => \n    { \n    endpoints.MapGet(\"/\", async context => \n    { \n    await context.Response.WriteAsync(\"Hello World!\"); \n    }); \n    }); \n \n \n11. HOW TO HANDLE ERRORS IN ASP.NET CORE? \nASP.NET Core provides a better way to handle the errors in Startup class as below. \n \n    if (env.IsDevelopment()) \n    { \n    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage(); \n    } \n    else \n    { \n    app.UseExceptionHandler(\"/Error\"); \n    app.UseHsts(); \n    } \nFor development environment, Developer exception page display detailed \ninformation about the exception. You should place this middleware before other \nmiddlewares for which you want to catch exceptions. For other \nenvironments UseExceptionHandler middleware loads the proper Error page. \nYou can configure error code specific pages in Startup class Configure method \nas below. \n \n    app.Use(async (context, next) => \n    { \n    await next(); \n    if (context.Response.StatusCode == 404) \n    { \n    context.Request.Path = \"/not-found\"; \n    await next(); \n    } \n    if (context.Response.StatusCode == 403 || \ncontext.Response.StatusCode == 503 || \ncontext.Response.StatusCode == 500) \n    { \n    context.Request.Path = \"/Home/Error\"; \n    await next(); \n    } \n    }); \n \n \n12. HOW ASP.NET CORE SERVE STATIC FILES? \nIn ASP.NET Core, Static files such as CSS, images, JavaScript files, HTML are the \nserved directly to the clients. ASP.NET Core template provides a root folder \ncalled wwwroot which contains all these static files. UseStaticFiles() method \ninside Startup.Configure enables the static files to be served to client. \nYou can serve files outside of this webroot folder by configuring Static File \nMiddleware as following. \napp.UseStaticFiles(new StaticFileOptions \n    { \n        FileProvider = new PhysicalFileProvider( \n            Path.Combine(env.ContentRootPath, \n\"MyStaticFiles\")), // MyStaticFiles is new folder \n        RequestPath = \"/StaticFiles\"  // this is requested \npath by client \n    }); \n// now you can use your file as below \n<img src=\"/StaticFiles/images/profile.jpg\" class=\"img\" \nalt=\"A red rose\" /> \n // profile.jpg is image inside MyStaticFiles/images folder \n \n \n13. EXPLAIN SESSION AND STATE MANAGEMENT IN ASP.NET CORE? \nAs we know HTTP is a stateless protocol. HTTP requests are independent and \ndoes not retain user values. There are different ways to maintain user state \nbetween multiple HTTP requests. \n Cookies \n Session State \n TempData \n Query strings \n Hidden fields \n HttpContext.Items \n Cache \n14. CAN ASP.NET APPLICATION BE RUN IN DOCKER CONTAINERS? \nYes, you can run an ASP.NET application or .NET Core application in Docker \ncontainers. \n \n \n \n15. EXPLAIN THE CACHING OR RESPONSE CACHING IN ASP.NET CORE? \nCaching significantly improves the performance of an application by reducing the \nnumber of calls to actual data source. It also improves the scalability. Response \ncaching is best suited for data that changes infrequently. Caching makes the copy \nof data and store it instead of generating data from original source. \n \nResponse caching headers control the response \ncaching. ResponseCache attribute sets these caching headers with additional \nproperties. \n \n \n16. WHAT IS IN-MEMORY CACHE? \nIn-memory cache is the simplest way of caching by ASP.NET Core that stores the \ndata in memory on web server. \nApps running on multiple server should ensure that sessions are sticky if they are \nusing in-memory cache. Sticky Sessions responsible to redirect subsequent client \nrequests to same server. In-memory cache can store any object but distributed \ncache only stores byte[]. \nIMemoryCache interface instance in the constructor enables the In-memory \ncaching service via ASP.NET Core dependency Injection. \n17. WHAT IS DISTRIBUTED CACHING? \nApplications running on multiple servers (Web Farm) should ensure that sessions \nare sticky. For Non-sticky sessions, cache consistency problems can \noccur. Distributed caching is implemented to avoid cache consistency issues. It \noffloads the memory to an external process. Distributed caching has certain \nadvantages as below. \n Data is consistent across client requests to multiple server \n Data keeps alive during server restarts and deployments. \n Data does not use local memory \nIDistributedCache interface instance from any constructor enable distributed \ncaching service via Dependency Injection. \n \n \n \n18. WHAT IS XSRF OR CSRF? HOW TO PREVENT CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY \n(XSRF/CSRF) ATTACKS IN ASP.NET CORE? \nCross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF) is an attack where attacker that acts as a \ntrusted source send some data to a website and perform some action. An \nattacker is considered a trusted source because it uses the authenticated cookie \ninformation stored in browser. \nFor example a user visits some site 'www.abc.com' then browser performs \nauthentication successfully and stores the user information in cookie and perform \nsome actions, In between user visits some other malicious site 'www.bad-\nuser.com' and this site contains some code to make a request to vulnerable site \n(www.abc.com). It's called cross site part of CSRF. \nHow to prevent CSRF? \n In ASP.NET Core 2.0 or later FormTaghelper automatically inject the \nantiforgery tokens into HTML form element. \n You can add manually antiforgery token in HTML forms by \nusing @Html.AntiForgeryToken() and then you can validate it in \ncontroller by ValidateAntiForgeryToken() method. \n For more you can visit Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF) \n19. DESCRIBE THE DEPENDENCY INJECTION? \nDependency Injection is a Design Pattern that's used as a technique to achieve \nthe Inversion of Control (IoC) between the classes and their dependencies. \nASP.NET Core comes with a built-in Dependency Injection framework that makes \nconfigured services available throughout the application. You can configure the \nservices inside the ConfigureServices method as below. \nservices.AddScoped(); \n \n \n \n20. EXPLAIN SESSION AND STATE MANAGEMENT IN ASP.NET CORE. \nAs we know HTTP is a stateless protocol. HTTP requests are independent and \ndoes not retain user values. There are different ways to maintain user state \nbetween multiple HTTP requests. \n Cookies \n Session State \n TempData \n Query strings \n Hidden fields \n \n \n21. HOW TO ACCESS HTTPCONTEXT IN ASP.NET CORE? \nASP.NET Core apps access HttpContext through the IHttpContextAccessor \ninterface. \n \n \n22. EXPLAIN THE CACHING AND RESPONSE CACHING IN ASP.NET CORE. \nCaching significantly improves the performance of an application by reducing the \nnumber of calls to actual data source. It also improves the scalability.  \nThree types of caching \n IN-MEMORY CACHING – Good for single server \n DISTRIBUTED CACHE – Good for web farm \n RESPONSECACHE attribute \n \nResponse caching is best suited for data that changes infrequently.  \nResponse caching headers control the response caching. ResponseCache attribute \nsets these caching headers with additional properties. \n[ResponseCache(Duration = 60)]   \n public class HomeController : Controller   \n {   \n     public IActionResult Index()   \n     {   \n         return View(new HomeOutputModel   \n         {   \n             LastUpdated = DateTime.Now   \n         });   \n     }   \n }   \n \n \n \n23. HOW TO ENABLE SESSION IN ASP.NET CORE? \nThe middleware for the session is provided by the package \nMICROSOFT.ASPNETCORE.SESSION.  \nTo use the session in ASP.NET Core application, we need to add this package to \ncsproj file and add the Session middleware to ASP.NET Core request pipeline. \n \n \n24. WHAT IS THE META PACKAGE PROVIDED BY ASP.NET CORE. \nThe assembly MICROSOFT.ASPNETCORE.ALL is a meta package provide by \nASP.NET core. \nTHE END... \nBEST OF LUCK FOR \nINTERVIEWS"
